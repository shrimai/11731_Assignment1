yes , good afternoon , ladies and my mouth .
and that 's very much for me to talk to you today to
and i have to imagine one of a moment .
my name is ben , and i 'm , romantic , is based on the city .
this is the right room for eight years .
and my favorite thing is : first of my favorite , second organization , the public matter .
so , i 'm responsible for the power of this city .
and you do n't do so that you do n't do
i know .
and that 's where my son really like , i also am .
i mean that i mean that i 'm going to be the
power is , and it 's got your
and i think , of course , of course , of course , to me , is a subject to me with what
so , with the subject of the dopamine system , it 's a point to me
we hope to the best , and let 's bring us the worst thing that 's called a music story .
you know him .
he was at general , at general .
and then i do n't start to say something as well .
i 'll make you one .
and this is how we talk when we 're using a risk that we 're just going to be a conversation , and we 're getting made
many people are on behind .
it 's a matter of it that it 's moving
and somewhere on the screen is a family , richard , left , little bit , maybe with a pair of people
no one seems to be done .
the french one is a little one
suddenly a boat .
let me get that out .
police , smoke , power .
people call .
namaste design .
go out .
what is there ? '' well , i mean , questions
we do n't know that , or we ca n't tell .
people would leave the building .
children hate .
some are even laughing because it needs to go quickly .
suddenly a piece of a piece
there 's actually been inside .
an fear curve .
i 'm going to talk to you here
the rest i 'm going to do the whole
but it 's not a concept i 've been able to accept . right ?
that 's exactly what happened in the week in berlin .
there 's a such kind of a glamour that 's
after all , they turned out , in fact , in terms of california , nine pounds of drugs
but the people were just like that , and so a friend was told me to the building .
there was nothing out there .
and it was actually happening that of this kind of thing at all moment in the group that my friend was in my friend .
god , you 're not an familiar , though , the whole bang is n't that hard as it seems .
you see , in an fashion , a kind of an kind of an collective event , communication is a
communication is important because the people in this situation is actually getting to communication .
they want to know what is going on .
and in the course of the good age , the old time was that for the people who
we just did n't have anything , or we 've been lied
why ?
because what is the essence of the indus
you have to tell them so that god , people are going to be in wonder , because we do n't know the truth or we say the earth .
this is at one time in the social media , in a period of weeks , in a period of facebook , in a period of men and public school , in a period of power and public tv not possible at the time
and simple and amazing because the first thing is , the first thing is , and the second is the second time , and the second is that we
you may remember , even in the local valley , you know , a year ago , a few years ago ,
the first one was about this point in twitter .
from someone who 's been on a ship , and showed me by the person and a romantic chair , and this is a plane , and we 're
that was not a rocket force .
you 're looking at it , we 're going to be able to tell you today , and to say about the truth of being the
because most of the past that we are , of course , the most truth of this , the truth of this , is that we 're going to be as a writer
because , in fact , in public media , or not , most of the private media have not , very , very
so , from that , we 're going to eat in food , and that 's also something that has been done by the media , we think about how we 're doing it
and we 're going to do the good old dynamic again .
however , just as a form of life .
so , this is what we 're going to do in the next few years of about a hundred years of life into the site of life that is , some of you know , it
so it was used to be that
you may know , even what three people know , once long , once a long time .
i do n't know .
we 're going to have the work now with all the life that we have in this place , in this way , over facebook , over time , talking about the air , and at the same time , and the internet and the
and we know that we need to be very fast and we 've got to work out and we 've got to go out and we 've got to get out there and
and we do n't always think that the believe we want to say .
communication is in the crisis of crisis or in a decade , in a second question of view , about all the media that have to be available to us , and it 's also a
and its biggest problem is our biggest problem , because the whales and the politicians say , well the next game once once , is everything , or they say , it 's all much worse than it is in reality .
we 've done some good things with facebook and twitter , still recently .
well , you may have some of them out the media media .
we 've been a bigger place in food .
and that 's what 's called chemical street .
these are white guys who are on a very tiny camera camera , because they just would n't be on the first stage of life , but the houses in the world war ii , and only the bottom of the chemical reaction , that is that a small piece of a small
the problem is , many of these , have never been working , and are just like in fact , like in fact , in a
and there we were on the course of an older book who said his own , he was told , `` the other thing he was going to do was , '' he was now , he 'd seen how she looked at the fact that she 's been on the time she 's thinking about , and now
and by the way , many of these have been taken up for many
we 're going to see what we find ourselves from .
these cows are going to stop immediately back , not be a parent , but they 're
and so , we 've seen that in blue park , and we 've been able to see that in a very small way that we
and in the end of the city , the city has this kind of communication and twitter and twitter , with the realization that the whole is completely far far about are more about
and the media was mad . sometimes the background .
we did n't have to even with those table , but they have open and open up everything about power and twitter .
so , all had a great effect for us , because the indus is going to increase the way we get into
just so , you have to give me a sign , if i stop .
i do n't look at that watch the watch .
this is the simplest thing that , because first of all these social media have the advantage of doing it very different .
not so very cheap because the police is getting there or the space you 're called , a high power .
second , long street .
if something does n't matter , that 's what the self says , `` the dog '' is that i 've just talked about , you know , because because the whole community is actually going to be involved in
and it 's a very high space so that if something wrong is , it can be very fast .
and we have huge power .
i said , `` well , honey , which made what a bomb was going on in dark park .
so , from all of that , we have all the things that are happening in the last few years , and there 's a lot more of more power than a few of them , and
and also the city , perhaps every day of view of this a few years of it
a horse that has been in a conversation in which has been in a park , certainly not one way
but it can also , and it 's also , after it , we 're also in the position of it , and then we get our power , and we 're trying to see
and if you think about yourself , think about other cities , if you have to get a test , because you 're having an so-called , you know , you ca n't have the blood effect you 're able to do , and we now know that , you know , a lot of thousands of them
and this is important to communicate , because it 's just in a world that 's driving enough to deal in order to make care of the way people want to make sure that people in the way that people in the way they can get this difficult situation .
and the social media helps help us in our own being religious , because , after all , they 're all at the communication , and not only one single , and not only one , and not just a single bit of danger is not just as we do in the environment
so , from this point , today 's not only a problem of the quality , not just a problem of fire or the power of life , of power , red & amp , it 's the power of red air & amp , it 's innovation to
and it 's totally shown that .
there 's been a lot of twitter , and about facebook , a lot of the people being done when you 're having a lot of the aid of the people who were being filled with this , because suddenly , you wanted to
this shows that 's a lot too much , too much for public communication , but the fun of the most fun to the power and the ice systems have just shown that the social media from a shift , from an communication , is no longer to think about .
and i hope that i 'm going to have a little bit about that this medium , which is actually the most beautiful things that 's used to be in the most part of the most of the world , and to have a whole different way of doing it , to bring a piece of this instrument to the human , and to use the money , and to do with the
thank you .
so , a nice evening .
i am totally different .
i 'm a writer and a guy 's , as you 've already heard .
and i 'm also now doing a little bit about a living position to do this .
what it is that i do have to make it completely , i 'll show you that one of them .
before i do that , i have to make a couple of things .
the first one is , i think we need to have stories of it .
we could n't live with the people .
and i think it 's a lot more power , there 's more , very efficient , to be more likely to get you to know that
and then i think the internet , the most famous amount of , in fact , is just as good as any kind of thing as it
and , fourth , i 'm convinced that people have been designed to be creative .
and they 're happier , as soon as they get to be creative .
the more people happy , the better the world is now .
it 's true .
so , the better world is just a secret .
first , i 'm saying , `` well , '' what ?
and the story i want to tell you is by looking at a meeting in a blog that is just a piece of light that 's
that 's completely completely completely .
and it 's completely complete early .
now , you get the most bit of the wheel , and you do n't like to do that much to do , because that 's where it 's been late , you know
it 's something like something in your head , in your body , with your perception .
and she did n't really have words for that .
you do n't know what 's going on .
i have asked words to do that .
i call that the magic of the main theory of
you 're going to get that one page and you see in blue and everything is very black .
i have a feeling that i feel like a kind of thing .
it 's true .
and on the other hand , we have the two to the same thing with a lot of color on the
and it was said to be in that part that i was better more and write as i could .
so , the first thing that 's happening with your new perception is a professional man with life is literally a high person you 're in front of you , and says , `` oh , '' at the way , `` oh , ''
that 's completely completely completely .
and complete crime depends on this to you , in a very different way , to a certain kind of
she was born as a giant being .
these are the players who have to be talking about their own high game to be here
who 's familiar to know ?
very beautiful .
imagine that a while is not in your own place , when you 're going to meet you , is based out of the boat
so , criminals , regulate , regulate , everything else .
what 's really important is the players do n't have a look at their speech .
we do n't know when we die .
i wish one of the time is that we do n't know , i just do
it can be all over the ] way to be all
and it 's something like `` with me guys . ''
you do n't know how much they can play .
that means , every man said , the last one can be said .
a player who has his entire brand has low property , is based on the level of power like a fish that will be completely
now you can ask , and now , of course , if that 's dangerous , why do you play that ?
and the answer is clear : this .
without play , without a food to get you , everything else , and only when a player is going to play in .
they were born in the game .
so .
this story of what is that this story of life , and how you 're going to do the world of the players , and you 're going to have to do the first challenges , and , of
and in a form of power .
the first step of all up 12 consequences , unfortunately , i 'm a completely completely completely working here i 've seen that too .
so , 12 pieces of magnitude on the first line of five minutes , it 's about five to seven
this kind of power , a piece of a piece of the other , beautiful stuff that you know .
but what 's really doing tv for its power is nothing
that 's not new .
and if it was all , i have a first job now .
and also , even yet here .
now , it 's just right here .
let 's go back to you again .
what 's the most famous sentence from the film or from the coral ?
it can just give you a , right .
thank you .
so , as if we had that time .
and that 's exactly what my blind player does n't do .
so , from which there is a very different way of
there are so many different games .
think of blogs , space , it is , it 's fresh , it 's moving and so on .
and that 's the number of cancer that 's been the number of
and so , here you 're going to be every kind of stuff that 's going
now , the next question is , who 's to tell me ?
i have a quite high idea of that .
i think of happiness , i think , of great creative .
but i know that a hundred percent of brains are more than just one , even if it 's mine .
so , it came straight to the idea that you 're using the african problem with the creative process .
what if we do n't just make it just a little bit of music , or value , even
so , if you say , we 're going to put a lot of a very different thing to do this with
imagine , for example , for example , in the context of three , a brand you find in the same way that they find a real class , because they 're thinking about
and then they 're a huge fan of power .
then you can just , with the technology technology , it 's not so hard to make a difference .
and this is the way that they 're going to put on this space , where it 's right , and that 's the really cool thing , which really is
that is , it 's not going somewhere , but it goes down right there , where it should land .
and what 's beautiful about this really beautiful is that we 're on
and the internet , you know , is really all .
so , every medium is worth it .
that is what you write as if you 're writing , you know , and then you 're using a test ,
and so , when we 're now again , we 're going to
what is a little bit of power 's web , right ?
this is what this completely exists in common has been built
and i 'm really really aware of this thing that the internet was born to tell me that kind of stories .
it 's not that many times , except no one .
so , now i 'm going to go on one step further , and i 'll just give the audience to be a
so , in a life is open
because you can also move with risk of those pieces of people , but you can also see against people in the real environment , and you have these
now , you know , what do you know , in the course of this , is that they 're all very good at all very
this beautiful areas , which is just very smooth .
and i do n't want to move on that , because i could n't need to do it over
we just looked together .
everybody 's made it from three parts time .
the first part is the most threat , the second piece is the power , and then we have to power .
with this life , i could have the radio driver , at least , i need to think a little bit about the most short innovation
they have the first price for the best of the future .
and i have to say , this gentleman was from the census of the census , from the power , open up , and so
so , there 's a lot of people to get
and if i can convince that , here with my mind , the internet is really using using these , more structures , the way the world is , i think , i can really convince everybody
so .
everybody 's got to say , why is this so much like this ?
because , in that white , all the areas are going to be
we have one that 's true , and that 's what 's called , who 's this , i 'm , you 're , you 're
of course , then you die .
in the far part , it 's very much more parents
everybody 's got to say , `` everybody has to die .
and of course , but everyone is now in the sense of everyone , if he wants to .
that 's absolutely important to me .
i come out to the site of life , and there 's nothing to be any more thing about what i think is when it
i do n't know if you know that .
if you 're in the theater , and then you see the sound looks like this in the mountains and all the stuff , oh , god ,
and that 's not what it is .
so it 's about 30,000 people .
and no one needs .
he can just be only successful .
the reason i 've got a writer is that this is the whole project that 's going to be in the hospital ,
and that also has a few reasons .
i 'm on this project , and i 've been always saying , and i 've been asked to say , `` well , do this all look at english ,
i 'm just saying , `` the german danger is the third of the world .
the most word , the word , is the english rate , and then the german state
so , it 's not like that , if we 're going to move in a couple of little
and i really think really really really , if it 's been really true to other people 's being grateful , it 's not something that is completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely
if this is all going up , i like to like to do this , then , the first step is now open on the first
and if you ask now , why is this now here at a space of life where , you know , under the music of music , there is something
i 've made a couple of thought about that .
i love christians .
not just power .
i 'm also responsible on power and power .
a couple of them have been around and completely in the
and i can just say that this whole knowledge is incredibly important , and it 's incredibly frustrating .
but it 's not using anything if you do n't mind .
and my project is simply really the same thing that i just did , and i 've learned that .
and it 's been built .
and it 's just that way .
i really want to say real .
so , if anybody is thinking , i do n't want to help me of that kind of thing , and i had to do a sense of a sense of life , or i say , `` i 'm a feeling of view
we find ourselves in the internet .
on facebook .
great , how do you lose the video ?
i also , i 'm a fan of mind
hey , you know , can you be invisible ?
question about it .
can you be able to be invisible
can you be wondering , because of all the things that are happening in your life ?
have you still forget that ?
who has given to all of that ?
they do n't go up to the hands
so , how are they invisible memories ?
apparently , anyway .
thank you .
no , that 's not the only you to do today .
then , i think that 's pretty short about that
again , my name is thomas ignored .
the talk today , i did a lot of talk , which is my favorite card , or my two great movies in the same way
i 've been a place here at the very study , and i 've been looking at the smaller and a lot to the same , and in a kind of very large
and most of a time i 'm now , i 'm now as a student student , and a lot of
so , i have a page , and i 'm looking at the computer , i 'm very excited about the computer , and i 'm right now , in the other side , i 'm actually going to completely get completely completely completely the human
how do you do that ?
that 's a collaboration that you have a
i was born in a very interesting discussion on artificial intelligence , independent miles .
so , the question was , when can we , when we can build a computer , what would be the human brain ?
so , and i think there 's quite a close to that .
so , i think , as two , three hundred years , i do n't need that anymore .
but let me just understand why you might think that this might be a little bit of a little
so the relationship between the computer , between the computer , and the brain on the side , and our
if we take the computer , then , there is everything , so your brand , your village , your whole card , and you get these cameras , and you all have the cameras all the
it 's called the heat river , central to clean .
these pieces are a variety of size of cheap city
the word is already every heard of every word , and it 's always like a symbol of it .
this is a little bit of a piece of machine that has three ice and the speed of it
in our computers , in our hearts , in our own business , i have been estimated that i have to have to be extra
and the fish in the wild actually there .
we 're going to do things that we 're doing things , we had to say that we had to hear an education system of einstein , yes , your computer can be able to do a lot , very quickly , but it
more than that .
it 's actually quite a broken artist .
we want to draw the way we want to draw with
our brains has been as an form of the brain , the mirror , and we have that , but i 'm sure , 100 billion , so 100 billion neurons are in the middle of the right part here
but the beauty is , our neurons do n't just have three connections , but they have all over to completely completely lower per
and this makes a completely completely completely completely completely completely completely , just because it 's beautiful , it 's
this is 10 with a million year-old times , you
so , there 's a little bit of the complexity of the brain , and it 's kind of higher than we 're right now , right
if we want to compare the energy level , maybe a one or other , the first time that you have , the first time you had your own power , a city , and with the bottom of the air , it was totally
our power is sometimes sometimes , but the box here is only about 2,000 watts up here .
and that 's the equivalent of two major penguins , so you do n't need to need and you 'll need a lot of it down there .
now , if we 're going to have to take some serious good part of this up , totally serious news with it , we do n't use that , why do
perhaps the one person who knows or another one of these public space , this : the human use only 10 percent of the brain , buy it to be completely open .
and there 's just a little bit about the advertising stage .
ten percent , perhaps , but our brain is in the process of our evolution , in the way our evolution of creation , which was completely completely smaller , is actually there , in the middle , we have a conversation of our power
that 's not actually happening because we do n't use it .
why does it so the way we 're going to make the most part of it ?
you know , you know , you know , the idea
i 'm growing on the way this was so beautiful to the study , if you look at the conference , in the ocean , you know , the top is the top , the ocean is coming down .
and those 10 percent mountain , which is about what our desire , our own mind , is , but , but it 's also a total of a mass of the way , it 's a massive
we are creating the listening to make sure that are made out of completely completely completely , very effective , they
and , you know , you 're going to get that kind of power on this memory , maybe that one can be
people who remember a lot more detail than i did n't even have the same thing in the situation and they 'll tell the people who are going to be in the back , but they said , `` well , how do you know ?
this is there , there 's a special , a special thing , a kind of music , you know , somebody 's driving , you know , in a plane , and you 're at a plane , and you 're at a plane , and you 're at a plane , and you 're a little bit of the
and not kind of like the web , and here 's this , no , every single house , every single door , every single surface he saw , he could have been able to get back to him .
where do you get that ?
so , why is that why we do n't , well , the higgs script is very close to the fact that the indus is slightly more access to its entire percent .
now we 're using that , but why can i not have to remember the very high night before all the details ?
sarah ford was really influenced by me to have interesting experiences .
he worked in the literature for an example of the literature , and he was working with a plastic company , who had been completely completely made of her experience , that was no longer the other , that completely completely the brain , that is
wonderful , so , that was very good at that .
now , it 's just about making people to make it real .
and there they are asking in a very safe way to the end of this thing , and if they could n't remember the very , then they could see the same thing on cars , where these people are not going to be
and in fact , with that little symbol , one of the voices went
the second thing i did was that , was he had a lady in berkeley who told her mother was sent her and back in the morning , and so four years .
and then she was walking on the board of her mother and her mother .
and then he said in a search act , he 's playing a little bit .
then they started to dance , she was four , she was , she could n't read , actually , this could n't read this .
and then they told me , `` tell me the power .
they actually found a copy of an area in the northern northern background , where that was exactly what happened on this side of the text that the
so , the brain has this page as it was completely completely , as a picture .
and then they could read it to
so yes , we actually have access to that , but we seem to tell in the normal life of life , we will tell us to be able to get the
now , we 're now , we 're not going to do the experiment in you , but you know , how do you say , there 's a little bit of a life , and we 're going to have to know what we 're doing , and we 're going to do what we 're going to do , and we 're going to
and , you know , it 's been a long evening , so you can get completely completely a little night , and you can get rid of it , and you 're going to go to your phone , and then
and remember , a very recent thing , positive event in the early past , yes .
take the first thing .
and if you do that , you might have some evidence that you will get that memory of your mind .
you might get a picture , maybe a picture possibly a movie ?
some of the things that do n't think they 're not just doing because we 're going to do so normal , but they do this
and if you see that , then you can either be either in the movie , from your eyes , everything else , or how it 's looking at a screen .
one of them is a call that is completely completely , the
thank you so much for thinking to make the thought again , the eyes is coming out .
who has a visual information , would they put it up ?
yes , there 's a couple of hands on the one that 's like , `` this is , '' bob , i 'm saying that , that 's about what i 've been asking , it 's actually something we do so that it was n't going to be
well , go on power .
now , in a way , it 's a beautiful thing that 's kind of a sudden , not only to the fact that we 're actually really feeling , you know , we 're going to see a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a
and now what happens discovered .
life was all at all before , yes , you know , that our brain is at the point of the kind of difference that we actually think of what we think we 're going to think about what we
and also , you can do this when you go to home and you imagine something in the future , which is not yet , you 're going to see something that you 're going to remember , when you remember something that was at the past .
and , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , these stories are like you are in
then , hey , there 's been that , and that 's that , and that 's so beautiful , and the more of these stories , the more beautiful things the stories are , there was a lot of a lot of things , there was a lot of a lot of carbon , there was still a lot of a sudden , because the
so , if we do that in this kind of thing , if we really do this kind of memory , why do we do this , i mean , i
true , when i came out , my uncle 's a picture of his career , from his childhood truck .
a very beautiful picture , it 's also a very beautiful dynamic .
only , the image is a little bit more beautiful than the kind of thing , and it 's a clear freedom , because it 's a little bit of a sudden , is that it 's a little more than a little bit of a way , because the sun is a beautiful dog , there 's a picture of the sun , that 's a picture of this
and why do we do that , not with our own thoughts , our own memories , to kill what 's wrong when i do this more , what i think about a thousand ?
they actually have an idea of freedom in their own imagination .
are you so many people you see them in the morning when they 're just so light eyes , what is that ?
i had no wait to have bad . i had the whole power of life .
really the whole night and the thought , did n't come to me .
i think it 's the way he 's wearing that .
the son is a little bit more angry to me when he came to germany because his mother was sitting in a wild and he made it terrible .
what the dad did , he has every night with his son , and he said , or have asked , what was the most beautiful thing about what is happening ?
what was the beautiful thing to tell you , and then he would say he would say he 's going to get it , and he would tell you that he 's actually happening with ,
and , in two weeks , it was the son of the son
and then it was too , okay , that the clients is getting away , to come back to that .
and this is the whole company that has done all of the past the most of the people who know , which is a real bit of a life
so , it 's not the memories that we 're changing in the way we 're , but it 's our focus on what we 're using to do .
and how much energy on it is or use , to
so , if you 're going to have to get rid of what 's going on , this is the moment today is , i 'm going to do this , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
what 's on the game that we 're doing is actually about to have something that 's been nice , and what beautiful people there are , you know , there was really the way that i 'm really
and then you take that , and you take it up
take that with your real power , and let 's do the financial thing .
or if you 're having totally busy , you 're going to get your head out of your head , or your wife , or your husband , your husband , you
so , you 're going to do the image here , get it to the very clear little time ,
is totally completely with power , so you 're in the background of the show , you know , you 're laughing ?
because they 're actually aware of this thought that this is funny .
and you can get a lot better in the situation .
can any memories be able to laugh ?
no , i think our brains has so much better to make everything to grow it .
but nothing is nothing because we can choose free , how much we we focus on the focus and how important it is an idea of a thought , it 's based on us .
my favorite self to you , you play the pictures of your head , you will put your power your favorite footprint , you give them every day , you get your life .
well good afternoon .
thank you very much .
and if i ask you to an patient , what i do in my sample is to do that , and i tell you that i 'm going to do with friends with friends with friends and i 'm seeing a completely nervous piece of a piece of wood and i see a color and
and if i can make it , you know , in the front of a car music , you know , a call to a classic music , then , in fact , that would be the equivalent of the old people who are just in essentially , long and
frank 's favorite day said about music is just like architecture .
and so , that 's how we do that with what we 're doing .
so , you know , that 's kind of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of
and then ...
so traffic is , in fact , that 's
that 's what makes you to do about my view of this point .
since you 're growing , it 's being growing from the power of power , something completely different .
we 're now today , as a result between the surface and the middle , the last age and has been seen very early in our early years , which is incredible power and
but we also have also realize that the more famous thing that we have , the more matrix of life , and the power of life is that
and we 're very aware that the so-called the crisis of the word music is not to the content , so the music itself is , but in its power .
so let 's ask the question how we can make a brand to make a brand that the music will take around , the friends and the power again , that we like to be so much of it .
how do we make a life that 's working on the verge of the space ?
we 're asking the phone that you know from the traditional wall , space , time , light , in the question .
so , for example , take the relationship between our mind and our
normally , in the stage , there are between the stage , and the
we 're trying to do the test
here , you can see a picture of our power .
the musicians are sitting in the audience , they 're getting more organic , so they 're starting to be in the order of their care , they 're going to play , they 're
the whole thing is going to be a little bit of a difference
everybody who 's known is based on stage , right ?
or that 's in the office .
in the traditional book , it 's like that you 're going to be more or less , as you get here , you know , as you see here , and you look
but there 's music , there 's actually not a look at all the time in
and we made it with a little bit about how we do that .
if you sit differently and you 're going to be able to make a complete piece of music , then you listen to
and again , we do n't have that in this wall , but four of the things we had to do was put up
the audience could be absolutely free .
so , at the night , everyone was in the first row .
important to us is that we do n't just make any set of reference , but that we think about the music .
so , we ask questions , which is , in the blue and the other , but also in the minds of the people who need to have the music to be so , how
and so , in the way , the khmer night is how the speed of the bottom of the bottom is in the position , the most `` the most '' ] to be
but not just the space of life and the blood will be able to move to the root , but also the connection with others .
and so we 're very happy that we 're doing this for a couple of years ago , with the power to work together , to develop ourselves to the music to make music , which actually was not the old .
and so , then , you know , that 's true for power , or for free oxygen
and in this year , we have a , if you want to get rid of , you know ,
we have a dog , for the first time , a dog with a power
we have the story of the mother of life with meaning , fresh , power , and it just gives us to a completely completely
so that 's also working in this way , because we have a big , big , that one of us was going to take
we 've been a very strong lot of money from people from all over the middle of the city , so that we
at all , this is something that is something that is something that is something
we 're incredibly happy to find up on power of light in the park .
the city is exactly as big as we can find great systems and scientific places for the kind of stuff , but also so small we can see .
when the year in the congo of the year , two weeks ago , a couple of weeks of paper from all europe , and the city , the city will be , in the city ,
the whole thing is called the winter system .
we 're now eating a database of students and students , who , in some of whom , are on , are careful , really completely
and to make a power that makes a difference that will be on the most expensive or in the eye , and the blood and the blood in a light of the eye , the seven to 10 to 10 will
also , too , but also , you know , the other thing is that you should be interested in a year that the world 's brand or the power of life , which are in very
we all do that in our own , and live in that area in germany .
that means that the biggest part of the work is getting more and on a space level
only three times a year , we let to make a remote set of a body on the year , and we 're going to add a little bit of a car set of a car , and we 're going to have the one of the other or other problems that are left
to give up to the university of the day , then , to 30 , to sell up to 30 pounds , to give a few weeks of a couple of weeks or a couple of weeks , and a couple of weeks , and then
and of course , in those '80s , the older age of the
now you could to start with this , you could all be able to do it a little bit
but our power is still going to happen .
we have this , in fact , in danger , we have a big community of all of us into the city that we 're supposed to do in
this is from the classic level of music , which is also about very practical things like the kind of money , because we have a motor table that 's going to make us with bread or a life that we have to clean up to
that 's literally being done in a single school store place that we 've done all over the year and
until you get to the power .
we 've found a whole bunch of these leaders that we 've been able to have to take in the living room so that the peace can
and this kind of thing is that 's actually the writing to something that 's been put into some town in this city and from the
they 're looking at a very special way of like this , in a sense of
since we got , at the beginning of the year , we could have been used to make support of the citizens in place a place , that is now the whole thing that 's
we 're losing out of the final belief that the classic music is a piece of sound , the right hand
so , we 're very happy to think that in the entire 30 years , you know , in fact , in europe , and you 're going to take your
if you still do n't want to know right now , how do you think about that classical vision , you 'll just get to see it over .
so , the next year , we 're back into space , and we would be excited , if they are there .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , learn .
you might think of god .
knowledge is to learn to learn the effect of learning , but i mean , for learning , i 've heard a lot more , and that 's also completely completely limited to you
knowledge experience , a beautiful point for the power .
what i 've been learned from art and culture is now , i can say a lot of it , because at the same time , i 'm going to get to be
and so i thought that maybe it might be true , that something is to be an accurate word to give you different other perspective , which is what i 'm
art is beautiful , but it 's a lot of work
you 've also been able to have that
you 're always going to get the laughter , though most people know the answers
why is that ?
i think that 's what it 's doing to do with the word about something that we do n't mean to be right right .
art , which we 'll say sometimes , that 's what it is .
work ? let 's just get that out .
sometimes again .
people who would work like that , that 's what i do .
but at work , we 're going to think about the power of life , and in the art of the rich distance of the way we 're moving into all that , we 're developing our own
and so , i have my ritual , i 'd like to share to you about three hours of the five hours that will all have the courage , with a point of a way to start it for you .
it starts with the power , for the childhood , to the end of the book , for my youth , i 'm not going to tell you of my youth , not worry about it , the word `` i '' i 'm going to do this for my life . ''
the interaction for the first part of my new life , and finally , five , special .
and a half one of them is that they know these pieces of the pieces of total
it 's about , two and a sudden
you 're learning them in the first two , three years , and you can touch , and i 've done a little bit .
and with 10 , 11 , i have seen these little pieces of little , on the piano , not far from here to get up at home .
these pieces of life live on one level .
there 's a little bit of a ball of paper , and the other voice are going , but
the stone is that it 's actually , but it 's completely completely
and that , ladies and gentlemen , is something that is more important about the art of art , that it 's about , and if it 's just two voices , it 's a way of looking together , it 's kind of like the future , it 's kind of like , in the wild , in the
and i learned , two , many things , sometimes , about the power to play in the same way , to hear any kind of a thing that 's about to hear a show .
that 's what i 've learned , among others .
another experience , i 've never forget , and i 've got the idea to make sure that it might be like to go to me
i have a piano , you know , there was more people in this room as i get here and in the middle of that neighborhood i came
i had forgotten .
i played with a career .
so again , at the end of the back , i was n't going to go back to
the audience has more longer than i am , because i went to the whole career on my place , and i would put it back and started the third one of the time .
and you do n't believe that i 've met that i 've come back
but this was a really serious experience .
maybe that was also one of the experiences i was doing , well , with the family , although i was going to get a life of it , i could n't do n't know my go , because at the end you can
yes , the next thing i 'd like to do with the next chapter of my day , i was able to love and i 'm
and then , when i was so completely , i went to my life and i told him , he was a little bit , he 'd like to
and he said , `` he is not going to be a
because you have to have a lot of coffee on a lot of time , and you have a
now imagine , a life boy , so , like a second .
i do n't forget that . i do n't
and from that point , i have still talked more .
i was going on to get back to a site .
i 've been talking to myself , and i remember a situation that i 've never seen .
it was the hardest thing about the local community , and now i 'm going to get the big work , i just did n't want to mind , and it was with the most beautiful point , and it had to do the same thing , and then it would come back
i do n't know it 's not a little bit of time , is n't a person 's here , and i could n't
i 've played this one half six , and i 've played that one right , and i
and then i sat on and i 'm being able to tell you , i 've played myself in a wheelchair , and i 'm just sure that i 'm going to take myself out of the
i was myself .
i did n't have a kid , nothing else , and i did music that was made that way .
and one of them i learned to do is to address emotions .
and sometimes it 's too true to work on that kind of extraordinary tissue to this state , i call it the case of life .
where everything are happening .
we actually had this situation to actually in the position of life in an organization .
and then then there was almost all that kind of self , and when we made it , it was only a few months , where you could actually need a few years
well , this was my experiences with the computer , with sure to work with .
and now i come to my ted , dancing .
i had been a student student as a student student , but it was a
we 've got caught , we have a lot of power
i 've got to have life and have my own life for my own music to the music , and i 've got to get it
in the air , together , in a way , a fixed dance , wonderful experiences that 's very , very close to me .
and then , one thing i came up with is the most common theater , which is the life , and i 've been doing this with the left , and i 've been , in my mind , and , of course , of this idea , of course of art , and culture , i was working , and i was in the position of
that 's the art of culture to allow culture to my own life .
so , here 's work for the art , but not as a artists , but you do n't even know , but as a light system , and to do something about something .
i was in the theater , and i was living on it , i 've never been able to do this in germany , just in the '80s , but i 'm going to have a phone phone , and i 've been looking at it , and i 'm going to ask that question to be
and that 's why i was also in my life , in my life , in which this space was completely , and i was in the process of life , and i
but before , another thing was , and i 've had this stage , i 've been able to
i got off to the city .
the german life has its own life .
i 'm not , even sometimes , in my own game , because i was born in life , and always that the actual smile is , i 'm going to do it just a little bit .
but i have a collection of a collection of a , because my family family were also completely secure , and that 's where i 've seen the most moments of
that was something i was doing that for me to do that , and suddenly i got into a different form of culture , a place in a position that is alone and of people in this kind of amazing device of life .
once the press was focused on us , all in a very different situation , in different scales .
and i then began with power , which is the local power , and i 'm sure that my friend and colleagues was , you know , we always have always the top of his music , he said , `` i 'm reading , i 'm a little bit of a
we made that completely completely so , but of course , of course , in the text of the power , they
and this thing that came out was really the people coming out of the
it was my computer that i was interested in high school for my own research , and i was certainly not with the wall .
i was looking at the next day , and i had a broken student , oh , the wall is really , yes
and i 've come quickly to leave you quickly , in any sense , to
and there i was , i was , kind of , kind of , for
and i 've seen myself how to use people like the same kind of thousands of urban cultures .
we actually talk the same language that music will come there , and it 's been very close to be , and a lot of it has
unlike the conversation , it was not given by people all in the same , but it was a lot of the room , and that 's what the western identity i 'll get back to , which is that i 've been able to slow back again and the average
now , germany is actually there .
now , also , the way that we 've been doing is that
i have learned to have a lot of things here and have been doing in the city of food .
we have been that , by the way , i was doing that by a kind of life , and you would think that 's going on here , and i started here , and that 's where
i have this one .
some thing that 's because does n't have to write it is to make it open of
i was the first of the first of the power .
so , i have n't done so much , although it was wonderful that i had this kind of life , but it was going to work because i could have been able to work in education and make it to the education and
we 've done a lot of work for the powerful level , and we 've just seen that mountain between power , and you 've seen that there 's this kind of thing that 's going on , that it 's a little bit of the way that you know , where you can see stars between the design
many , many of the buildings could have been , and i could make it and i 've done what it means , if different people from different areas are different different systems .
you notice , i think i 'm trying to figure out and that i 'm increasingly going to have to change the art of the art to culture that will , to the fact that we think of this approach between people , between cultures , in the way , in the way ,
in fact , in humans , then , with the subject , we have been the subject , open , seven , the idea of the idea , at the previous age of washington , the life
but this last project , this fifth project , has seen the queen .
this word , it has two options , one i 'm asking me to do something , and i can use it as a woman and say , i do something that is , i know something .
and that 's always in its face .
i know something about his favorite trick , which is why i say , i 'll give you , or the community
and i 'm going to talk about something that i 'm going to get and say , `` sorry '' to me , with that i can share me
and this is a big deal done .
five people are trying to move to move every one , and they 're capable of creating the way they 're capable of being able to be able to identify and realize that they have a
so , as a big , we called it open up , but it 's also a community of a community , a kind of a lot of the people who are in a major , very common language , but when the genes here , and this is our ability to deal with the people , and of course ,
in the words that the power is about the death , many others are different
an experience of it has n't been so many people .
there 's been clear and food , two schools , working , like , young girls from the power , and young students from a nation school , from the way of people , young men , are able to find out of them to a
and it was a remarkable effect that young girls ' own friends are using boys , and young employees , and then young employees , they 're sending , of the young men
and there , one of these young men who got to the university of the day and showed that light that i
and , at all , then he 's called a letter and he said , `` she wrote him back home , as a young baby , he played me , and i could never play a little bit more detail because my two legs are being alive .
and he 's putting his fingers with a brand , and then it goes back to the piano in that play with a brand , and it tried to play
and it did n't leave him .
it was a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a
we learned to think that there might be essentially that many people can move together , but in all the things that we 've learned that we 're going to have been working in the place of peace in peace and to build a way to change the way that we do n't talk about them because we 're
and this was a wonderful experience for me , and you can see it 's not just about learning to know something .
it 's always learning to experience something and to win with you .
and if we were doing much serious , and invention , if we just get that we 're going to help and culture and culture in our own position , in the process of what we 're going to do and also the end of our own identity , we
and i hope that they have a lot of power and they have some kind of thing that they 're going to
thank you .
yes , thank you very much .
i think we 'll just be just on the first slide .
so i 've been able to get to power to support my apartment , and i 'll get
but , you know , it 's not scientific moments , but it 's about my life 's point , and i 'm going to find a way to a theme of a theme , where i think it will be done
and i finally do n't know about this kind of thing , so very much for what ted means , and i think in the area of life , we can actually see this
and then i had heard that you would think that you would be the talk in english , if somehow could do it , but you would n't be able to see what i wanted to do english , i do n't know how to say it , and i have the talk to you , but at ideo .
how we die .
i 've got to tell you about that one first .
but what 's been like to be the one of the hospital that i 'm getting to get in the
she was over the same age of old and he 'd been trying to get out of the little , because they were also the same thing that was the first man to be in the war .
and so every year , they have been the first one , and they went to the dance , and they got long and probably on that , and then you 'll get a completely bit of a lot of life too , and you 've got it , and you 're going
a couple of years before , she was also looking at the same way , with the same experiment , and he did the left leg .
and at the time , i was there , and then , there was a doctor and i 've seen how to be used to the main care of the world care , how they were being used with books , and also also became a little bit of the
does it really understand the same thing to make a `` old people like this strange meaning to use it
so , act of being focused , in the gulf of weeks , is that one person is at all
and she 's been paid to have been available
five years later , i 'll come to the hospital , and i see the name , and i can tell you that 's it , because it 's so rare , too , and it 's been taken in the back of the back .
so , the question is , what do i do when i actually talk about how a person is supposed to decide what he is going to do with her , or what is to be true ?
and that 's kind of a little bit of the play .
and you see that there are the threat of the end of the end , as
it 's a book from me , how we 're going to work , a report at the time .
and then it was that globalization was very strong , so you asked it , how do you do it ?
you have it , and you can still read that in this book today , just as it said , it 's going to be a heat cycle , so the parts always
it will be a brain 's brain of the work , it 's going to be a lot more longer in the work , for example , in china that was a big
and so , again , that 's basically the work of the individuals , so something that 's kind of a little bit more different , and it 's always been low , it was always more likely to be used by the quality , it was the quality
and that , after my favorite scenario , people always could always have less and less more effective from their work , and increasingly more part of a small amount of life , where it was about to do so high to work in the way that they were doing high power of work
and if we 're doing that now , we 're now running up on power and medical space , so , of course , it
if you hear on the television , what doctors are , are , doctors and the most of the most successful , they 're completely called completely
and this is not something else , when it has to be treated , what you 've done is that it 's completely completely , it 's not being successful , and if it 's not enough , it 's not that the medical police is also , or the medical school treatment ,
and through that piece of perspective , the work of life is increasingly more and more and more more effective , that idea that you 're going to spend the work and using using a difference with the kind of a space , it 's about , it
a great friend of mine is now after the end of the end of the room because he did n't want to know that in a very common practice , he has the left , and she went after to become a doctor
so , the power of this kind of work is that you 're looking at this kind of work , and it 's been a little bit of a piece of work that the kind of thing that 's been , you know , it was a little bit that there are more old people being going
then , you know , the hospital will be clear , will be back back , or at the end , and then we 'll
and this baby has been thought , if it 's kind of a sudden , if it would take me to do something that you 're going to do something about this layer of space and also completely completely completely completely from human beings .
now , in the meantime , he had been looking at the fact that he learned the language of a lot of the time , and that 's exactly what happened to this conversation was happening at
it will be made up into the same time as well .
it 's not more the dog that 's safe , but it 's actually being discovered in a lifetime , and i want to be not depressed for example or not to be a good bit of , or is
and then the trick becomes the point .
in the meantime , it 's like the third days of this conversation is to come to the end of the talk of the day , and you have to get yourself , i want to be , i want to be in
that 's what i want to be , i do n't want to be compassionate .
so this data goes to an area , and there 's this kind of science , and there is this doctor , there is the memes , and then the decision are
now , if we were to think of open on power that would have been done in the little bit of the little bit of time , and also , you know , in a while , a student , i do n't want to get into them , and then you would have that second , you know , you know , you know ,
and that 's my friend , i think , is that there is a lot of competition to do , and that 's very much more
and the last thing is that today , today , is that , today , about the year , about the equivalent of the year , is about to die about , in the u.k. , in north america , high people , and that these areas are actually a very strong , but they are often a deep aggressive of what they are
there are a lot of land that are very good about , very real people who are doing it , but when i look at the level of things , and so on the year , so about five , the players that may be on us , i would say , it 's hard hard to
the whole thing that this has been made is clearly to make all this control , this control , which is that the money is so far , because at the end of the money , the people who are going to have to be the most to be done to the treatment of the treatment of the care of the treatment of the
now , this is not really the fact that you 're really sure about , but you need two degrees benefits in the open you and you have
this incident of quality control as a result of a lot of the people that you want to make a sense of , so it will be in
and now i 'm going to come out to how you might be able to do that , and so what we 're going to do now in the last time , because i 've asked the same questions , and i have to
and i just just like that , and the paper of my life , because i think a society is always so much , too complex structures that we have all the way to society .
and in fact , in the essence of paper , you see , it 's an complete
and the second thing is , you 're developing your own life of life .
and what i 'm probably really is to have is a third sentence in there that every single one is that every single one should be to be able to protect its dignity and to protect
because that is a way to yourself and to yourself , to yourself free from this moment , i 'll take that to other , and that would be sort of and i would n't put it up and make it , and then i do n't have to
because the last thing is , even though we 're going to do this topic , we 'll be going to come to the point .
hopefully , it 's just late to do with a hundred
this is obviously my career for saying , and this is what i call people , but at some point , i want to ask you , but when you 're going to do the subject , and if you 're going to do it , or you 're going to be
now , if you think about that , what is that what is that , what makes me do , then you 're going to come to dots where there is the last thing , what is the fact that
there 's now a book that 's quite smooth .
it 's the meat of natural , it 's the friends that i have , that i can take me to work and write the way that i know , and that me and i have a whole story of life , it
it 's safe to trust and to people i am also able to do to do with that , in the middle of the most part or a wheelchair or a kind of a or a different person with a kind of people
and there 's lots of little of these cases that are being there , and i do n't all like that .
but if you look at these three points , then you have a lot of jobs , you know , you have a lot of jobs , you might have to be able to get in life , and you might have
and then another level of doing that we see a certain kind of water , and i actually gave this one as a text , or as an example of it .
other people can be for us to take these choices and the behavior that they do n't do .
that 's my inner mind .
and we just would come up with ourselves from ourselves .
so , it 's not the question of what is going to be like that , but to do that , i mean , who is going to have to do , is it , is , or
but it 's exactly the same way to ask , where can i be able to focus on people , and i would have my room , and i would have to be able to make that questions and make it all over the way
and then , if you 're saying , how we 're going to work , so this space of these body is that we 've been on the outside , it 's a way to say , i just start to get my own life , that tiny
because no human self can help me , how do i want to see , i think , to
and i 've also got to be able to get into this in general life or the way that you say , you 've got to get a muscle out of school , because you 've got to get in love if you 're going to be more comfortable
so these questions , i can probably be able to work on in the last few , long
this would be a very subtle device that would be , and not the outside , to me in the outside , is to not be able to have an law , and i think of other people , and i 'm very confident to do , if i have
and to make these kind of talk , and then i think it 's dark , and that 's why i think it 's in the same way that i 've been doing this image of it , and that 's how to do it , where a lot space is , it 's not
so , if we 're old , if we 're old , you can say , oh , well , like a dance in may , even though , in my words , it 's something that would
thank you for your attention to your attention .
nice good evening .
i 'll give you two things .
when you 're the first part you have to stand on top , you 're going to
there 's another second one .
let 's start with the wrong seat .
this is sad , not , can you .
what do they mean ?
are there different ?
or is n't that happiness ?
yeah .
that 's not good when you 're here with a meeting of what 's wrong here .
so , in fact , but i did a fun to do it , for the ones that know it .
that 's not what we do .
we only are just one only .
and i like to the war would like to make a little bit
together , we know we 're making a fake technology to know one thing .
and it 's all about the place that are in the place of
when we 're running in a vacuum level , and you 're creating two points , where one is in a instance , a kind of
we know now , we know , we know , we look at the box , the number is small , it 's three meters , and it 's three people .
we can do , if every amount of the same amount of stuff in every single way of
how do we do it ?
that is , we would n't get people to get , two , three , we 'll get the three , the blood , the three brothers , one , two , three , three and three , three , three , and wonderful .
what do you mean , yes ?
very beautiful .
so this works in a very difficult great way that it works in a big number of numbers ,
but it does .
how do you even count ?
how do you get that much more likely to do this as many people like ?
i have some ability to have some hair , and people made and i
right ?
you call it the blood !
so , you know , that 's not clear , right ? now we 're going to go in and you know , and we
not , that 's very beautiful .
so , you know , you 're calling it a little bit more and it 's working in
you take one , you go on a chair , which is the mouse .
the next thing that i 'm going to do is , the next thing is , everything is the brain , many people of different sentences , no mouth being born and the pollen is
now let 's go to the main demo
how do we compare two messages to be a different amount
we would say that one is like a big or bigger or smaller than the other .
so , what we could do ?
we would go back to go back .
right , that 's wrong because the point is that when you start to get in a ] long long long long long , i would just say , you do n't get to any other .
harvest , terrible , is you sure , right ?
so , how are you ?
sebastian ?
no , be !
she was actually going to start that way .
celebrate !
so , now we 're going to look at this .
does that even bad is bad , yes ?
you 're looking at it . you 're not a movie , yes
the point is that you make it quite simple .
if i take the power to take , you know , natural numbers , to get together , we 're going to teach you the zero at the beginning , zero , one , two
and we 'd say , let 's say that a copy of that kind of thing that we 're taking to take that kind of text
left on the right , okay , zero , two , six , eight , eight ?
okay ?
all right , all right , are based on the most famous long book of natural numbers , but on the one hand you 're missing the most line , the lights , the lights , the lights
we 're going to call a lot of applause of the most basic number of the most basic number , we call
what do you think ?
is more powerful , is it bigger than a high leader , like a great one or
the same thing ?
but this is very powerful , yes , in a case , that is what you have a
who is another rule ?
smaller ?
who 's more bigger ?
ah , who really really do with no plan , yes ?
that 's not what you can not be ?
you ca n't mean where that 's missing , bigger , that 's not going to be done , right
okay , so you say , you know
would you be thinking that you would be
that 's the most bad thing you 've got , of course is wrong .
and now , now i 'm just going to explain why the whole thing are
how does it work ?
right .
yes , we 're killing you .
that 's the point .
we 're killing .
we take the number amount of the space , we take the zero from the natural amount of the brain , out out .
the next one is two : after two , two is two , after one , after the zero , and i 'll continue a life .
the four , the two who , the six who , the eight who , are four , the four , are
you can turn this out , and then you 're going to have that , and then you 're
and clearly , by the way , we are able to make sure that i think it always is to get a completely completely open up at the
and here 's one that 's just the right shot behind you , the book is a long time , yes
we are the natural thing on the right side , so we 're going to make it out , and the book is still pretty
that 's just the norm .
so , if you 're going to explain some things : what we 've learned today , is that , `` what is `` terrible '' and i know that
an infinite amount has a character that 's not not in the most dangerous place , and that 's the character , it 's an absolute resource , a real amount of mass that 's
they do n't want to do that in a vacuum system when they 're being affected by three three people , and then there 's one there , and then it
yes , we made it up on here .
is n't that a common person
okay .
then we 'll have a second part of this , no .
the press , creative opportunity .
here 's what it 's coming from
at this experiment , i 'm sure i 'm sure that third of the third of the third you know , and it 's going to be someone with the
so , let 's call the baby a , b , c .
i 've got a little bit of light , and i hope you 're not heard .
and you need to guess now .
where do you , i have a little lights , like a guy , b or c ?
guess what 's happening , our life , here .
they 're choosing to c .
who has another idea ?
a one .
who has a idea ?
♫ no , sit , b has a little bit of a way that never thought , `` do n't hear
so right ?
it 's really not bad , so you do n't have to get me to the people who get three letters and i 'm looking
it 's really not bad , right ?
it 's very clear to do , because the chance that they 're lucky to do is just a third thing to be honest .
in contrast , there are three things , it 's really not bad , yes ?
now i do this , i just do one .
well , i know , where it is .
so , in fact , that 's somebody , you know ,
so , i know where it is , and the matter and it 's true , or whatever it 's called , it goes into a second game .
so , i 'm really going to show you the kind of a little bit more and
so it 's like , we 're going to go into a second game
now , i thought to say , i 'm looking at me , a way
so , now , i need to show a door where it does n't -- and you have n't told .
because , if you say , `` well , if you 're saying , `` i say , '' and i know , it 's
then there was no second play .
i 'll say , `` honey , '' of the mouse , sorry .
but i have to say , this is helpless , the second game is to go .
so , i 'm just one kind of core , which does n't just have just not , but you have n't told .
now , the question is , and this is the cultural opportunity under the state here , under the mind that b is open , and it 's not what it is , you have now for your final chance to guess new .
you 're going to be a little bit now , and then i make a little
i 'm going to do that what they want to have .
or you say , i 'm making c .
now , the danger is , is it more likely to be more likely to know
so , being a very nice thing , b is b , and now i know it 's called white
or , god , thank you , that 's a b , i always wanted to be a little too . that 's it .
or , you would say , it 's kind of open , we have , you know , we have to , we have , we 've got to get there , we only have two lines ,
what do they mean ?
it 's not impossible .
it 's true .
why is n't it anyway ?
very beautiful .
why is it that you are open ?
yes , exactly that 's wrong .
and this is what happens , almost if we were going through this night , then it
so , they 're like , you know , they 're a new job , so
so , the thing that 's really completely cheap , yes .
and this is what all of us do , i do n't know , six and i know , i ca n't do that , i ca n't , i ca n't
so , it actually did n't know .
behind that door , it 's a third of it .
and it 's always been one third of the people 's behind the door
they can be aware what they want , they have two key forces in the classroom .
that means that you could n't be on two lines , not , you can be able to do with them in a way you can do about two ways , and you 've got them to go , you know , if you 're going to go to zero , you know , that
but here we have just a door .
so , now , you know , two green is not what you 're doing .
so the two third here is , but it 's only just behind the door !
behind that is not .
so , what about that ?
i mean , i got it really !
so , what 's more likely to do ?
it 's better to stay , or to be able to change ?
now , it 's easy , yes ?
yes , of course .
so , that was n't really hard , right ?
ha ha
what do we see ?
they have failed wrong .
why ?
simple , just two third , are not 100 percent , the difference between the theory of the theory .
i hope that it was for everybody .
thank you .
mr. enough you 're looking at me and you 're looking at the fact that you 're wearing , you know , just of the moment of being drugs and poor and people have
but i 'm calling my best to come back to everything , and that 's when it comes to .
i 'm going to go from the fact of the inner farm and the one until i was a fan
that 's what it 's doing . right ?
yeah .
thank you for coming for me .
i grew up there in the mountains .
and i do n't know if mr. competition was working , and i was doing that , whether i want to leave my ted at the heart , and you want to talk about a
i was totally totally aware of trust .
now , bad is not bad , and i 'm not going to get the woman out of the woman who said , maybe that 's a one or a more other
i 'm also trying to have a whole deal to
so , i left this morning to go to the train to walk on a second time , now , it 's a lot of money , but i 've got to get home in the same place , because i 'm in three weeks on the top of my own , from sure
and i just just would n't start by doing that in the end
so , the head of your own , the power goes , in the morning , in the mirror , i 'll take you with
i 've been told you , i 'm just , i 'm optimistic .
and i started , you know , you 're going to have some kind of
no worry to worry about , the beautiful , little muslims , the blind trust .
i 've been doing it for a moment of time , and i 'm on , how do i read the best thing i 'm going
so , i come from two village with six houses , very kind of power , some of them , and my parents in the lab are here , and you 're apple , and you 're going to get out of them
trust , of course not in the environment , it 's not in the position of mind , in
why is i tell the story of where i 'm going to come
for me , one of the most important things i really did is i really look out from the country , from the village , and there , with two great friends , with the oldest brother , who is completely
and with the second poem , it 's the same as the blind that i
`` you know , that looks blue and dark , which is like i 'm seeing to see where your windows in space is , it 's light in it .
what 's going to do is we 're very careful for
well , you can see , or we 're both , you know , when we 're
online 's chicken , but i do n't tell you , is fully completely the complete man 's being honest .
the point of the old men , survive .
and then we get close to that
and what i 'm always really important is , of course , the fact that you trust and you 're seeing this great trust , that is that we all need , you know , something completely because of an actual situation .
and that was my parents to be able to make them like a lot of them , and my brother and i do n't know any of the
we were so the first ones that we 're already completely grateful into your life .
and then they had to do something like this .
and now , i look out , it 's a huge news that my parents had n't had to come to us as to even , to say to us , to say , to us , to us , to us , to us , to us , to us , to the hand , to be able to get
so there was a little bit too . we did n't get home with
and b is our parents 's giving our parents from our own to go forward , to where it is our own brother .
so , in the house , it 's being a little bit of light that 's going to go up
there 's a blind writing , and then i 'd like to make on with these two deep ice
the more complex the more complex , i 've still seen today
so , that 's the big age -- that 's not just good for the instructions , but for the power .
and our brothers and and my brothers and i , we know , we 're doing , really , everything outside of that , which is what the car could do , in the same part of
and that 's what the ted brother with writing , with three years , and then , of course , we wanted to know --
and then you start to move with power , like , as long as you 've been doing , today , with stage -- that 's completely
until you can get that power .
but we 've started with something that 's happening , to be without time
and then the big question : how did a look at the way that a
and how you think that you would imagine , one of the people that parents would trust that the children will come back to the office and get out of that and do the trust of what we do n't actually
and the solution is , of course , we have a given of our parents , to have been able to say , where are the traffic , so where we 're a car where , a car where , you know , a car , you know , you may be able to do any of the things , you
and we needed to get through to the future , to hear the rest of the rest , but
and you can not see that in this moment in particular , because otherwise there 's this thing , there 's nothing else that you have n't been thinking about
but based on the night when you turn down the light and you see it in your room , and you will also want to grow it
can you try to just just make your own noise with your blood so you can imagine and you 'll find that it 's a lot of people as well as to connect them , and they 'll hear a
so , as you hear , you hear about power as you hear your wall , you 're going to hear your wall , it 's a lot that
and that 's for me to trust , and so trust , in terms of movement , it 's really important to
but there 's so high success of success , and the problem : i have a chance to make a chance to help me with that
and i 'm also making myself a big designer and clear and a half of the community , and i 'm also , of course , one
what i do n't know most of these times is that i think very carefully about one of our power is as children .
and that 's from the end of the home building building on the
i wrote here : the chemistry is growing up with a totally diversity .
and i 'm very literally , and i 've been looking at it , because i was as a person who 's been in the same way later , and in the process of power of the design page , it 's about a point , or i never am like
now , one thing that 's never been used to do this is
but , but it 's also true to do that , of course , it ca n't just be any kind
what 's happening is that , in our sense of our power , to be able to know where i am fine , what i am going to do , and where i can be really my
and our brother smile again , who 's his brother and i always sat on the edge of the house
so , then , yes , we 're going to do a complete field here
you can get somewhere out of your windows from the order of an example .
and the team then went out , michael and i , probably probably quite completely completely completely completely little than the girl saw , `` you know , do n't know how
but then , you know , who are going to end
so , i do n't .
and i think the games , we are the generation of young women , not yet .
and from that 's what i 'm going to do with you .
and then the realization that we 're just the most popular thing is that we 're all seen three degrees of life , and the father with a little bit of our family with two with two with two with them
because trust is going to happen when other people did .
so , the father would have said to me , to help , help , help , about the fact that one of us had to be a very , very fear , and in power completely , it 's totally clear , and it 's not
but , but it never happened .
he would have been so cheap that he was also going back again or a team that was going to take us to take .
and that , i thought , i found i had a great thing to make these possibilities .
but sure , not worry , this is not a helpful way , not a effort to do later .
for me , the different types of different , which was all important in my life , all of me , interesting
and , you know , they all did n't care about it , because i just saw that , where i was looking at my character , which is maybe my favorite work
so , absolutely good means that i could never get that way .
and i never had the kind of thing to
and i do n't like to go to today today .
i 'm going to go to this talk today . i 'm
now , not at five times the moment at the moment .
and at real time , but what happens is that it 's better than
but i always said that i would trust that in my life system that i think of as different games i 've seen .
so first of all , i think ,
and that was quite beautiful for me , because there was the company who was going to be on this room , and in fact , we have a serious , so , if we have a , you know , we
in fact , it 's good because there are so much on each other 's seat .
and then you see what the other power does .
and there was always such my big thought , of course , if i 'm going to get the work long , because , then , the other thing is , if you do n't know what i do n't do .
so , there 's only one way : and that 's the trust to my most space .
the other hand , the foot in the same time , and then the question would go to me , and then you can walk down to the level of life , and then he 's going back and then
i 'm not going to try this one .
i thought i was thinking about her .
i think that 's a little bit more useful than that .
and i 'd do n't have any money here here , right ?
khalid .
i 'm going to pass on touch . i
okay .
the next thing i was looking for was the next thing i was , as a teenager , as a teenager
my parents were in home or are now in today and they 're also as children as children .
but for me , always in school was really important , how can i move a lot of time and to move to school in my school ?
and i was like an opportunity to make care of school .
and although i was always thought , that 's kind of boring , because there is something that is kind of like a lot of the equipment , i think
i used to be in a way that i 'm not now today .
i then said , well , i 'll do it with space .
and then , you know , you know , first of all , the person , again , that 's the big diversity in the classroom , because you need the whole power , you need the power , you need some
are you there are a lot of stuff from your work ?
that 's what it is in real life .
you 're going to quickly go back to you , if you 're doing this full trust into your own
if you think about that in your own power -- the force that you 're able to do is to believe in every condition that the bad space is , the bad line , the open of the air , to the open trees
and when you 're in my case , in fact , in my case , in
because when it 's a little bit , that 's what 's really happening , i 'm
and i 'm never quite able to see what 's happening about today -- i must use the word -- my life -- there 's only one -- have just my work for me .
but nothing we do -- we 're going again .
i 'll just like to take on the picture now .
so with one thing , one of them later after you after another practice .
what i 've been doing is doing the issue about the subject of the work that i do , that i just want to tell you about this as it is , if you do n't have to make it open , and not to
you 're going to have to have that , you have two points on your hand
so , sure , i do n't even lose you a hand , i could say my call the most life and look at the actual thing .
do n't do .
so i have to help me differently .
i then actually started to have my favorite life before i was going to
and i think that 's the voice with the voice .
so , it has to be very accurate to make space
and also that is important to trust .
the nest maintenance collider in communication , in which it is in the
and the most part of me always always get me apart when it 's on the ground , the guy who says to me , and he says , `` on the left , '' i know it 's easy to the left , so the top part of the world 's
if he says , `` on 10 times a little bit of applause , and when he says , `` on 10 .
okay , all that ?
then , absolutely , if you 're totally critical , because then i need to play again or it 's going to get me up and do me again , i know
and for me , this is the whole , great , if the power gets on me , i have to say , completely , to say about the negative .
to make sure , he is for me to make sure that i could make it very quickly , and in the environment as a matter of others that start in the same conversation .
and i 'm going to do that if i can make it a little bit , and i have to make it a little bit , and i have to make my own life on a leg , and i have to make it open to the bottom of the eyes ,
and then you have to get so power , and then you have to look at the other leg and the same thing , and you have to walk down and you can
also , too high hair .
yes , and that 's really obvious for me to say that , and that 's really obvious to me , and i 'm a really good about how to say , `` i 'm just really so , '' and i just say that i do n't say that , `` hey , you 've got to make me alive , because , you know , it 's
so , i do n't know what to say to me .
so i 'm the one that 's going to open him open out the way of communication
and that 's what i mean in every task .
if someone does n't know my own person , he would n't help me , but i 'm just asked to be asking , `` well , i need to do a point of you , '' you might have been
or i need to take you on you how you look at the cold that you can also tell me how long after the mountain is , because if you 're going to document up the space , you 'll think of a moment , now you must be over
and then again , again , again , that 's not the thing that does n't
and i think , for the back , i 've been looking for the old family , and i 've been looking at the way the pilot , and then i 'll say , we know , unfortunately , we know , we might have heard that -- we 're going to have to have the blood age of it
so , i 'm important about that i 've been interested in for me to have the right , very powerful
i hear -- there 's another other one that 's going to be optimistic right now ?
who 's going to do more
so my best lesson was still growing up , but it was in the september of september , and now in the classroom , maybe i never never had that much faster , like , ``
and at the moment , they 're totally completely completely power
and to me , what i said , are these in the most beautiful , can only be able to get my ears open .
and the other thing i just did was tell you that one thing that he looks at and to me about the possibility is , my own
and that 's a really important thing to me , because i think it 's more , and it 's not a mess , it 's
so , for example , do n't get that much as bad , which is , by the way
because i had the experience that i had a complete right on the right and left with a simple .
and then this was in the case that the day was bad , because it 's the next three meters in
and i am the three meters only .
so , as i said , it was then -- of course they 're missing .
i know that , because there 's a lot of life , so you have to move to it .
and what i 'm going to do is i have the more abstract to do with people , and they say , `` well , the
so then , right now , unfortunately .
well , in the very few times , it 's not
but sure , in an situation of play , you probably know all of the time or the death of the work , the death of the people as it has to be
then , of course , suddenly , often , are often really hard
but to me , what would i say is that the most successful trust of trust in all that i need to
and i have to say , i 'm going to say , is , i mean , as a person who 's not seeing , is relatively big , because i 'm on
so , basically , i do n't know , so pretty much .
from mars to keep to keep the lower tree , the lower to drive , the question i know and i 'm not doing , but of course -- and that 's the problem -- i 'm also
so , that 's going to be too going to be able to do when that 's
and if you found somebody who 's actually the same hundred percent , as i do n't need it .
and i think , well , in fact , that i 've done the
because that 's really what i think about the next thing , very important .
you need the same goal , i need to really get clear , which is it that mean , really , trust things ?
because , in a lot of the more complex stuff you used to do .
i trust that or the one or i 'll give myself
but the most important thing is that it 's too much true to it .
you know , you want to trust that .
and you also are -- because we humans are all human to get rid of our own mind -- we want to see power meaning
and the sense of that is that we 're also able to make a little bit of a way of getting a target
so , we can do it -- in my case , for example -- in the words , weeks , i am on the space .
and i 'm on the right here , and i have to look for somebody who i have , and i have to trust that i 'm going to be able to do that mountain in
and how do you make it , you know , in the mountain , at the mountain , at a
well , i had the most kind of thing that i had , i did n't see , i did n't see some things to do that , when it comes
then i was quite a little bit of a
can be totally benefit , fear is not a problem .
and i worked , and i 've worked back to the fear , i 'm sure , i 'm going to work in any of the position of life , and i 'm going to come to the one , and i 've made this stuff , or it 's in ted
that 's what 's a little bit more likely to do when you 're going down the bottom down there , and you can hear the cars , you ca n't even have a lot of things to know where you know , now
and these things are always interesting for me .
you know , to have power , to know that as too , to know , to know : hey , hey of the end of the day , i 'm going to believe that , and it 's kind of making you feel
and that 's what makes life is something that is completely , because at the bottom of the top of the top , you 're going to be able to see that there is something that
you 're going to go and go and only legs are just moving around , and even less plants
you take on power power , you 're running off the world 's seat , right , you know
so , if you look at the real brain map , the power is about the last one that 's being
and then , then , that just happened .
we 've only seen the solar panels only from the distance , or the other one
so , from that with me , there 's a great trust for yourself -- about its fake , a fake effect that he had
because i thought to myself , well , i said , i 'm probably going to get away today , just as the thing to do .
but , as i said , it 's kind of cheap because you 're not going to get much change now .
and really interesting will be , if it 's been a bit hard .
so , when you go to the site , the air is being cut .
or if it 's next time , if you 're totally little light , where your left is , right away .
and then , in fact , it 's particularly beautiful and if it 's still home and you 're still in the back , and you 're all off that , and then you 're still going to have to do this , and then you 're going to have to do that ,
because i had a single bit of a date as a person , and that was the one he then
and we think we 've got to have a sense that i just said , well , of course , i can do my friend , my friend , who was , i 'm going to trust a hundred percent , and i 'm going
but i need to focus in a way to have the kind of security you to do to focus there , because , you know , if you 're going to keep out on the mountain , you 're going to be totally fast , right
you 'll get on some point . all you 're going to
so , for us , we trust ourselves in the case , we 're looking forward , so we put a piano out to the mountain , which i 'd made in the hand , and then behind you , you know , the sound
and that was completely completely completely being completely completely to make me a little bit more the near moments of the back of
and she 's only there 's a little bit more happening to the foot , and you 're having a little bit of the foot with your power , and you 've never seen that i 've actually had to come out of me and
and what i did really show you , as beautiful as it is , if you 're , of course , at the top you 're going to have to get that goal back in it -- it 's kind of like the power of it , with the pollution .
but the other thing is , i realized , i realized that i was thinking that i was in myself , that it 's only about just a way , if i do really make it really the top .
but the trust is also in others who have been completely working to the trust .
so , when we got to open up the mountain , we were actually right back in the group of the other seven people , and the other one of them was going to go and they were all about us and they were going to have been
in the day , the girls are not going to be able to
it 's not the reason that i 've been .
and then i realized at a moment , `` well , sure that the trust of trust in their ability is pretty straightforward .
you go back to the dark , you 're going to go to 12 o'clock , it 's not no light .
this is completely painful when you 're authentic , the air will be so hot , so only only is still there , and yet it 's not the
and then , at least , the moment that you 'll have been said : no , the human being totally been totally comfortable to go behind , because the old one has all me , we have always been ready to -- how the women are going to be
and they told us all the night from us and the other night , and the other one was there , in the same way , to know how to do the pain , to know , to know , ok , it 's
or i did n't know what a lot of other things do n't tell you at
and that 's what 's that you know , it 's not somebody 's going to happen to this , and it may be just bad about that , maybe we might have time -- it 's just going to be a
these things , that sort of a sequence of the outside , as well as far as it can be as far as a great amount of time , and can actually
and for me , what 's happening is , in fact , it 's been that , and it 's been a perfect thing , and it was a perfect thing , if you 're the kind of personal and that what really
and of course , in the conversation of the gold project you 're so -- i actually do n't know why the more material you do -- maybe , you know , i do n't know to test the value of music or a sense , if it 's just
so , i think , at some point , it 's like this , in the early business , it 's
if all of this really happened , i do n't get here to this , i would be on the driver store , i think
or at least at private circles , totally power .
but as i said , i think that this is the thing that you do , is more that you can imagine : what i 've been doing , i 've been doing my skills and forces in a way .
now , as i went into my mind in my own , but of course , in the team we all need , no matter whether in the trial , in the job that is also
whether or , you know , oh , if old husband is , or young , we need to do people , we
and if we actually have this goal in its head of that , we actually have a eyes of eyes , and we 've done that the best evidence to be at least in a project we could trust
and if you can , you can either do either a lot of different areas .
thank you very much
a science for me , this is the name of my talk , which is , after , is based on the beautiful
what i 've been doing is that the whole thing that 's actually is the most profound property , the science that 's coming back into
basically , i could be a happy point .
so , if i look at a remote view , there 's all the danger of the main life that 's being on the scientific
even every single thing is that a whole range of power is being used by power , the gender , the most part of the most common stuff ,
every line on stage has a power where science can be done .
even if that is totally completely true , if you look at what it 's doing in the age of childhood and for children , with
each image has a kind of a piece of view of life , but yet it 's a very accurate story .
science is one thing that can i love to show , i would love to read , but that 's not what i 'm doing .
cool , cool , is n't something that is just as much as common , with creative situations , somewhere , are there that are the white
in the high way , a brand goes five minutes , does n't deal with the reality , but that 's cool , right ?
i can look at it .
big , the big thing is that i 'm going to tell you to laugh in , i do n't understand that glasses
that 's extremely bad .
because , that 's kind of a little bit more a little bit more a little bit of a little bit of the future that we
but at the same time , they did n't write up to
i 've just seen some examples of examples of how science is happening right now with us in such a way .
a very common example : in london , you have a beautiful building , and the architect , and it 's not as close to us , we 're going to build that as much
what happens is that the distribution of the rise of the inside of the tissue is going to the end of the tissue , i think it 's a bit more high , and then it 's going to
and this was full of the press , because the most of the most of the
bad , the heat has been so rare that this poor being being completely only being done for long long , long , because the real is of the most
and you 'll say , a concept of an architect , and it actually does n't really have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a sense of
so , what i found up , is a lot of a group of being in a plastic , where he was suffering with a high restaurant .
i really wonder what has the more design or a design or a design , where it has been working for
now , this is a completely practical example .
a great thing , which has been done with this kind of stuff , is also the
so , it 's a lot of time , and it 's a few years ago , and when it came into the
there was a train involved in the train , because there are plants plants , and that was once a danger
genes was the green of green .
genes actually has a sense of choice .
fish , oh there are genes in the ground .
there were moments where there was really going to be done in the market , hey , i have to have a
no idea what that means , yes .
so , yeah , okay , sylvia susie , we can just get it .
but at the time , i was working at the lab in the lab , and i was totally frustrated by the time , because i tried to make these evil genes in my bacteria , these
and it was totally pain , came home , and my boss would say , `` oh , you 're not happy , what 's happened ?
i like to say , yes , i 'm trying to try to change a little gene in my own days , and that would n't work .
so that 's what i tried to explain to know , sort of , kind of a protein , genes , i thought , yes , i think , well , the good lady , if i talk about genes , you know what she is
so that 's what i really meant , i really wanted to bring a certain element that i wanted to get into these very totally power
but this was what the woman looked .
this woman , never , ever , he 'd never go back
who knows what i am making you to grow ?
genes is what 's wrong .
now , this is already 10 years ago , and yet , this is kind of a mind of consciousness .
genes , this is something that is missing .
i mean , i 've read it quite long anymore .
it 's always a social technology , it has been , but it has really been to our language .
power is about europe , a news .
so , you know , they 're growing a little bit of different people who had no
another disease , diplomacy has killed with each other time .
yes , it was also a beautiful pleasure .
but , you know , they 're not that old , and it 's very hard at that point , and that 's
anyway , whether it 's time or the image , everybody 's talking about the birds
fortunately , it 's not sustainable in the realm of being being there , but i 'm afraid that does n't mean it too
but that 's just what 's going to happen to the people in the population , because they just simply did n't get the
we have to have a lot of time in our future of all these
now , it was just clear , and nobody was n't the big one on the subject , but it 's going to be done about things that are n't really important
and this is pretty sad .
what 's actually actually doing this information from the lab ?
so , if we remember this small , young , religious scientists , in the lab , has an experiment , a little bit of a sudden , beautiful and good , and it is nervous , the people who is that it 's really known to me , it
then the first thing that we have to do is go
the head , who will be , okay , cool to see his name of this as a first , is it always important in science , in history .
good idea , i still do n't have to be in the public , but i still do .
yes , it 's going to think about it , oh , great idea , great , that 's where we 're
so , it 's true , so we have a press with a project , a beautiful idea , and then it 's kind of out out
that 's going to happen , yes , but at who really ?
now , these are the kind of the internet way that the internet is , they have been , they have many
and from all of these , the power that are right , the right cool projects , then the power to the ancient , the rule of whether it 's authentic , it 's being transparent or subtle .
that 's the way .
from the ground , it 's going to fall on and over and over , and in the wild system , the really cool times that really , really , really cool projects ,
these are the primary european foundation , which are really good , is there from everybody else 's free , but what i am doing with it ?
basically , just the ones who care about it .
in fact , we call that the space of the most space .
so , the ones that are interested in that care are the final , yes , it 's beautiful and good .
beautiful magazine , the audience who are really interested in this and that perhaps about some point , where they 're actually not doing this kind of thing .
who is that i 'm really doing ?
the amount of those that get it about this matter .
the decision that was now -- the internet crisis , i call him the time `` mr. '' who read the other other of the other people , i tried to try to make it more , i do n't really know .
yet , again , our future will be just kind of -- in fact , if we 're going to move with these
by the way , by 1991 , a journalist , rural energy , is all those things that are cheap , the word is to not really understand and think about what it should be to
my project , my idea is to take a little bit more comfortable , the small young scientist , of the immune system , to get really completely completely from its normal power , and to give him there a little bit of a
so , what happens is that , in the case , that a scientist , i have a bone company , we know , for the time for six years , he 's something that is , it 's a soft rule , it
and as soon as he comes in , he 's walking away and he 's telling us about
so , in the way , these are scientists that tell you what 's going on
so , interestingly , the smell of being , are careful , is just as much as genes as genes .
terrorists 's effort to do this is kind of , oh , you know , you know , not
and the really teach you , in a way , is to get beautiful , and all right , if you 're on a conference and you 're going to see the people , your youth , on an honest sense of view , you can tell me
where is the problem , really making it real and normal ?
so i went to school , and this is my idea , these young scientists , not much far in the top of the top , which is a little bit of a more meat , school school , and , how
that 's all possible for everybody , it 's very , very , but also , investors that you want to know what it happens in the space .
and finally , that 's also successful that will be used there , so you have to do the next thing .
but the process that i did , that 's just a story .
i 'd like to put you to go into a tour of the eye , and you should have to imagine your project , your project , a project , a little bit , you know ,
there 's a quote i do n't know if that 's true , that 's what 's great great joke : if you ca n't just explain it , you do n't have that idea .
so , the scientists from the lab to take and their project are really , how can i do the real normal system ?
so , like stories , there 's a couple
so , interestingly , it 's modern , it 's everywhere , in every university , most of the night , but you 're all there , but there is
who will move to the end of the city at some , a talk about the university to a talk to get to the end of the
that 's the one that it 's about interested in this
and then i got back to my life .
so , these are the people who are interested in the conversation that will be , and there are some little talk of talk about
this is beautiful , so , there 's some real thing that 's made all you 're all excited , all right , go home , and that
so i 'm going to start to say a second point , and say , it does n't stop with this very space
these scientists are still more comfortable , how did they get kids ?
because there 's a lot of really , many really that are the way to
because scientists , like the physics , and how kids interact their world is real .
kids work very incredibly , very clearly .
they make something like this .
they 're trying to do what , does it
power , keep down , do n't work , you do n't work , you know , the computer project , i change a few , i
children learn incredibly powerful .
these are real real , power and behold , i look at what i think are going to make to change in to make sure that it works or
this is normal .
but this has a lot of press .
and from that point , i think it really works that if we can get the space of the room and these scientists , and these scientists , in the neighborhood , with the kids from the school , you know , in the world , in the world , with the school of the
and then you might be able to talk about some of the hope that 's my hope to tell you , and then i 'm going to go back at this home , and then i 'm also there , i 'm also going to be
so , that 's not somewhere in the newspaper , it 's not somewhere in a vacuum , but your kids tell him something that it 's working on a place that it has been a bread , it 's a bread that it has paper , and then you might also have to do
and not just that i do n't just get out of my mind of happiness , but
that 's my idea , my vision , my project .
unfortunately , it 's still that the first life i call , said they said , `` well , no , so , for our scientists , that 's not just science that have just been on the other .
a scientist must not be able to communicate .
yes , i think , okay , i 'll call the next one of the time .
but what 's happening in a state of working in a state is in a company , and it 's also the same , it 's the
thank you .
i love to be the question .
you ca n't fly every day .
the last couple was terrible .
the weather has a big house through the election .
i 'd been asked seven , so eight years ago , i 'd asked myself if i want to take
i was at the late age of war , almost 10 years ago , and in fact , in the form
we 've come to come up here .
it 's been more than citizens .
and to me , it was a little bit more , well , that 's completely completely
what is it ?
it 's true that 's actually ridiculous .
i then have heard of the mind and that i am here today .
and , maybe it 's a little crazy , but it 's also very ridiculous .
it 's beautiful and it 's always been exciting and it 's great
and i 'm just going to show you in the next step , 45 minutes , a little bit of this life from
i 'm a hospital in danger .
the company has been a hundred and more half years .
i am the happiest of the power .
this company has been done for over 20 years .
and the geese of the glacier chain
the company has been there for about inspiration or a quarter ,
the game in the front of the front here here
survivor .
and one of the picture i 'm showing you to show you the little thing is that this is actually a light , so a great deal , or something , because it 's still the same point .
there 's only been absolutely about that in the world
and these are actually just 10 options at all over .
that 's what you 've seen .
there are about 2,000 thousand types of global data .
so , that 's not a market .
it 's not even a tragedy .
this is a power , a power .
and the question is , why do you do that , right ?
how do you do it ?
in fact , in the middle of it , we 're only 10 objects , so we 'll be back again , we
and i think that 's just a
so , basically , one of a sudden is completely clear about the census here
very long natural .
we 've got to get on the first war in the first war of war in the
then in the first war , in general , death of death died , and he was leaving , they were made out of
they have been closed up in the high and so on . and so
and when we came to london to london , and to fly with a large life , there was a huge campaign to fly , and the english was being totally entirely with the election : that 's what 's coming on , but not with dead , but in
so , the story of it is that it 's called
and we had a cool campaign .
but to power , the client , but not so very , but it was clear to him , which was this time , what was the old memory of it in the front
and so that was just a little bit of a problem for the kind
but yet , it was a good campaign in london , except the weather in the north , and many years ago , many years ago , it was
and we are not a lot .
then , on the course , life has been about half , right away with
and then a completely piece of a life , which then then after america was
this is what 's called a myth that 's been thought of the entire british nation that 's been thought about something , and it 's been a little bit
there were that in new york , then there was a little bit of
and the entire british nation has been clear , we 're talking to who .
that 's in the way that you have in all the dimensions of life , and that 's really a little bit about
but in fact , then , as you can see , it 's about being power , and it 's only five , six , seven , and actually just got two really big to really have the wild to
so , amy , 100 , where you 're on the age of the speed , and you 're
but it was a myth .
and the only thing that happens then then was the first life of life was born with a lot of
so , after the web 's mind , the event in the time , where a kind of a piece of a product is a product ,
also , the other tools have been brought .
and it 's true , it 's actually the last time more than
that means that the materials are used for open , is open up ,
and it was a lot of nothing that was n't
and then they had the wild to be in their own life , and they would have the idea that they had the idea , maybe
and i was being amazed because you have a great product , we 'll get the right to do it , but the market .
is he even one market ?
what 's actually there to happen ?
so .
we 're talking about that now .
the danger of life is to explain that in a moment we 're actually looking at the time , and we 're still going to have to grow up ,
there are many companies that are inspired out of this particular group .
it 's been distributed to people 's total , about 20 billion miles
this is a real world , high diamond .
there 's a lot of it .
and i also have a look at this as well , to come here
the lesson to you in fact is to have a very free plane , like any other plane , but has a gas , it 's a gas , it 's a gas , it 's not a female ,
it 's like a feeling that is a very instrument that has to come up and have it in a way that
and the time is not there to explain to you in the detail .
in the context , a kind of a kind of thing that is
there are two types of power .
there are historical things that are really , in the case , are focused in the case .
they have no structure in the place , and they 're like they 're in power
these are the most vulnerable ones that built in the world , about four , a piece of time .
and what 's only today about this , as i said earlier , only has been in this case that has been really more active in the case , so
this is what the production system is , if a fish is being taken .
the bottom of the structure is coming on
and the third is also a program .
come from the power .
math : the power of the congo .
there are the instructions there ,
costs that a two million dollars can be a brain .
and it has to be open to be open and must be available , because always , you know , if a person would be in , or a hole that it can not be able to do .
there 's a little bit more complicated to do this again , and you see that it 's going
and then , in the end , a `` a '' without the size of the size of
so , the dutch is a very profound way to
and you see that there are the numbers down there , very close to the numbers
one of nine percent , one at nine percent , a number of six percent , that means that it 's about a thousand thousand , maybe a thousand thousand , in a
so , that 's very small and very good .
that 's a power environment .
they can see it .
but there 's another system that 's going to be thinking about right now , and that 's what i 've shown
we had three years ago , three years ago , when i started , recently , i started married , eight years ago , 75 percent , and last year , they 're going to be
and this year , in the course , was 95 percent .
and if you wanted to spend the eight years , i want to get rid of the eight years and you 'll see that in this eight years , and you know , a single member of the space industry , but of course , you know , in this eight years ,
we are completely completely completely .
we can not fly that up in the window .
they want to see something .
and they move , or in fact , every year , every year , is
so a little bit of a piece of the people 's doing is that our art is not just thought of it , but we do it in every
but because that is , this is good , has the medical budget to make a program , to make it very , almost 10 million dollars , and we 're an incredibly serious part of that
i 'm just going to look at the stone morning
the apple is here , in the other hand , is a flying lab
it 's called the campaign .
and we are doing power in the open power between the earth 's surface and
so , it 's called stones .
and the former bronx , from italy , comes from high to the speed of light in a
for many many many , many hundred factors are different , and the bottom of the air like the kind of thing that they 're doing , how they respond to our
i just just thought about it , we 're just there with the second tv box .
a great one was a great .
and you know , if you want to make a look at the point of
so that 's what we 're doing .
and here 's some of the main puzzle .
the list of the truck at the morning , i 'm going
and in edinburgh , there 's a lot of the weather as well , with the weather , is
the game list tells you never never never ever ever seen it
i 've been doing it right now -- beautiful people 's point .
the prison were n't not bad at all .
we were also in africa .
and for de de , you 've been looking at a level of time , and you 've been very likely to look at the bottom of the country ,
you too also be wondering , this is all africa , is to ask you to know what 's going to ask you to a notion , to look at a notion of why the movie is in the movie with the film , or the fact that you 're at the
and i asked myself , what do we do here ?
and what do we teach us to do ?
at the end of the end , we were going to go to
the stone age was n't going to go .
the whole thing was getting clear , and then the project was then then then
and a dog has the front of the front of the back , and then they had so emotional that he could go
but not so bad .
we had so good teachers , and we were pretty happy to do .
that was the prototype .
and i did n't know what to do with it .
yes , what we 're doing today , a very short bit of a long bit of the day
what we 're doing today , it 's about complexity , it 's about questions , it 's about , growth or education .
what we 're doing today is the traffic here in danger .
we 're made of course .
we need to get the mosquito .
true is called the philosophy .
there are always been signs of insects , after 10 , in the other way that they have to be treated .
we 're just using the whole threat for almost five million dollars .
there is something about that , right there , to do with
we do need to be able to do the space of
we 're a constant power of power that 's being able to use in the u.k. , and we 're using the european layer of the people and the only way that we can be able to
that 's also true and cost money and still get into it .
the question is : do you really go on ?
so , do you want to go
do you make bigger policy ?
there are real , strategic power rate .
what do you do ?
are you going to the market ?
are you going to go on the way ?
and that 's also what we 've been trying to do with it
and we also have some kind of competition .
but the way that the indus couple of these are some real has been fixed , and
at the beginning of the study , it 's the only bit of power
the chinese population had been sold in this for the time of six million cells , when the fourth brothers was diagnosed and he was basically a finished , and he was able to make a mistake on it
and it 's at least with power , and the other companies , we were , we were not there , or i 'm not there today , and also other companies , they
we were in edinburgh , we 're totally sure
we were , and you hear , in san francisco , to a client .
and it was a very serious prototype .
both projects have been familiar .
so , too .
at the same time , we have totally
and i have no picture of it because we ca n't show that in our own paper .
but in america , you know , in america , the most part of the first life is
we have sold three different machine .
with power , we develop the process of a partner to make technology .
and this is a big success , but the main bear industry was actually .
two are basically electric electric , because it was n't .
why did n't we end ?
we actually know it .
either , the most right thing is that the right or the soviet war did too far to the right or the fact that you know , in america , you know , that
the nurses have been clear , the face saw , have said , `` oh , '' again , a life that does n't make a difference .
there 's no question that the question could n't know that you 're going to
and it was really less difficult to get in the marketing , or , hey , people call it and get it up
totally close to stay there .
the russian mountains are growing in the year , they 're running out to be effective
but last year , we just have a power of all this out
there 's certainly been one per million .
that 's bad .
the monkey is called the cloud here , and
it 's the sense of which is beautiful when i look at the other way that the viewer is out and the ones and the laughter , and we 're basically doing a national thing to do , and we 're not going to have to be able to get that out , and we 're going to have to say , you know , it 's a beautiful thing , and it would take her friends , and
and we are great young .
i 've always had to go back to the very mistake that you 're thinking about .
you could still do more jobs .
we have a demonstration of something we have on . and we 're called
but that actually actually is n't .
we 're doing great seriously .
this is another science project that has been built up .
and what 's been done with this is done with the island of the
but the power is a great market .
and you sometimes have to be able to ask yourself , is n't that sense ?
we actually have enough state , but internet has a lot better to do the power over the back , because the power control everything .
the power is far on it , because it 's still about 10 fundamental activity in the world today .
we have three here .
two forms , one in which , of course , is that three has been completely open , 10 are
so six of them have died .
so , that 's what we 're going to be able to do , if it 's in a
and hope that is again to be able to make a future .
and what happens at the bottom of david , the founder of the apollo church , after its power to peace and five , he said , `` this walk can be the way of
so , it 's a beautiful thing
advertising , we 're going to do beautiful .
only , we 're not trying to do
so to make true , we find great , a technology value .
we have customers .
that 's not sustainable .
it 's open , it goes on and off .
so , one of the insurance needs to have a chance to get that
and then , again , again , again .
there 's also a wonderful thing that 's easy in and hard to control .
so , on all of that , it 's the situation , it 's a place in the world , it 's
yet , we do continue to that
it 's a medical state of the region .
the power are the power to make it .
they just ask the question : what 's shape ? what shape do we take it ?
how much money do we want to live in the developing
what do we do about this ?
what is the form of that ?
and i personally , you know , i asked you to say something personal , i 'm going to get some personal , and i 've been doing something that i wanted to do with the great wave of things , and then over the same time , and also , it 's going
i was also done by the number three years , when i was growing up by san francisco , and all these red things have seen me that i had this kind of cool that i could do with it there
and then there was a gap about the u.s. who 's about the money who are just making money , and not knowing what they should do about it , and almost
and then they made me to prove this to cool .
and i 've been doing three years of life in the world , and i now do this in hope , for a long future in the person .
zero , right ? 5,000 seconds , i 'm still finished , thank you .
morton bast
yes , thank you very much .
that 's my three dots i want to talk to you in the store .
why are we in the verge of the gps or in the
how do we get to the table ?
and most importantly , what do you do ?
what 's going on ?
let 's start with our first point .
the first part is a little bit of a genius .
but it 's also the case that the challenges are too much to
a few years ago , that 's still getting more difficult to explain .
we have a problem today , which is a child , right ?
that we have the infrastructure economy .
but it 's always that way , again , as soon as it is , it 's the challenges that are available
all sorts of power are produced by the form
so , if you look at it in a recent long time , the energy for the energy , it will be a very short way in the history .
now , at the moment , we do n't want to imagine that it 's kind of different to us as that insects always
you know the climate change , the last total years .
some people say , well , then they got in front of the time , and let 's see the last thing we
you can look at that too well , kind of , kind of , which
you can say who needs to be there ?
you can also say the ocean is far away .
but it 's already happening when you 're able to get a little bit of work with things to make things that really feel , we just did n't have trouble with the power of health .
it 's true about 30 degrees of time .
and there 's zero , in our cities , in our cities , in our cities , in our cities , and you
but also , it 's also about the power , especially in asia .
think about the beginning where the great ice ice looks like , and the impact of those are there , there is a water water from the
it 's not about the planet .
the planet is what we do , there was a lot of bigger to it .
and on the end , but it 's all about us to help the people that are very very very very very very very very common
it 's about a variety of species .
the oxygen population comes out of it .
the average tree is getting less less .
this is the sea sea , where an actual part of our happiness comes from
and this is all where i get from ?
all bad things , say , i 'm going to move on one another or another kind of shape of the global animal .
and what we get out of the earth is what we grow .
not just that , the oil and the people , and the banks , but also the psychological resources are in high , but they get out of the
and we just want to look at us that we use that as little as possible to build in the past world of all the time and energy
so , this is about what this happened in the late days was , in fact , the entire animal had really focused
this is the challenge , not only climate , not only c , to get two , get out of a car in another way , to live in a
different to economics .
our technology completely changed .
if we 're just a moment that we 're looking back in time and the viewer and the wind , and there 's still on the earth where it 's all the way that it 's in basically , with a mechanical
in fact , in the '50s , it was the equivalent of the human history of three to five tons
today , it 's 15 to power .
so , it turns out that these individuals have
and it 's very , very smooth distributed on the earth .
it 's more than we 've gone to be more than the earth 's gone on .
and in other parts of the world , look very , very much less than that .
and that 's where we put into the impact of the impact of the world that we have , the most fields that the air has been much better in the past decades , but it 's basically about the fact that we have
and the other parts of the world , but they 're all less and more .
and so , the problem that we 're seeing is that we see from the way of the people , in afghanistan , where they look at them , they look at the paper 's paper , and then they see where the
and that 's pretty much what 's happening there , which is , there are many resources there , where the world is on the world .
so , if we want to fix it , we have to start with the subject of a
so we have to change the laws of the world 's laws , all the way that are completely
and what we have here in life has is like not power .
this has been given by the van soldier when he said the world had enough to pay any of them , but not for everyone 's office .
and we 're here , like we 've got a lot of life here in the average .
so .
that was a little bit extremely low .
but i always think that you need the need to understand , to understand , to make sure what it is .
even if i would say that , it 's worth like it 's in life , it 's more connected to life .
but it 's always again and it 's like that , from the general you need , you have to have an expert , say
so , what is it ?
and we have to realize that we have to look in our numbers , in the world that have been so much more effective , political to quality , in the average , but not at the average
here 's a pretty good theory of what 's going on , but there are people , and you know , you know , people do n't have that good at all
i 've been written there .
open and climate have the same cause .
we work too much , too hard .
that 's on the one side of a page , in a sense of time , and eventually , it 's
i 'm also trying to do a very
and on the other hand , we 're able to do that .
but what is a good life ?
how do we define that ?
now , a little bit of a scientific analogy here .
and also what i 've been asked to you , and what i 'm going to say is to say is art is , but this is just about how i mean , first , how can i do
and there 's important to understand that life has always been two things .
and what we have on that is the moment of the objective of the most of the most of the
i have a roof over my head ?
i know friends ?
i mean , i mean , can i put on life ?
but also , what do i do with that ? do i leave myself to that ?
i 'm going to pass that sometimes to quality quality .
and then you get two things that are important to have important .
one is a need .
the need to do that , the need of the kind of fundamental dimension of our human development , which is about
if we can have our needs first , then we 're happy .
and you ca n't say to you , you ca n't say , needs a lot
needs to do need to do not need to do that
what are need to be ?
you can sleep with a different scientist , i 'm just called two door here
and there , obviously , you see , of course , you see , of course , the physical needs ,
for protection , for smoking , for a search , to be creativity , to be creativity , to freedom
this has a little bit of what to do with money .
but to a large part , actually not that , but the question is , how do i take that in my life .
and i 'm here to tell you that second important thought .
the strategy .
the strategy i use that i use that i 'm using that i 'm going to have to meet this
and there 's already going to be on , i can figure out a high set of a high , and you can do a
i can do a lot of money or make a lot of money
now , metaphor is my behavior with me as a result of my behavior
that 's what i do with my own self , with the resources , with the opportunities i have .
if i have a little money , i 'm going to try to try to try to make my needs differently than i have a lot of money
it 's about the power , it 's the roof on the head , eat food , and then the power of it .
and here 's the point of it that can be able to do with a lot or little , and it can be a lot
and when we take the whole animal that i have to stand to me in order to have my need to set up , then we 'll talk
so .
that was the kind of scientific writing .
and now , what can we do now ?
how do you go about that ?
and just just just just a few evidence .
of course , it has to find everybody who 's got to find
but the evidence of this kind of sense of sense on an important way is , which is , i mean , a lot of it was still about technology , and i also finally
what can we do ?
what can we do ?
what do we do ?
so , where do we want to go ?
the slides at the beginning , in the beginning , have said that the danger is that we 're actually using more and more resources to
and last , the quality of life would have been more worse to the quality of the mind , and so you know , and we 're
or , if we can , we can make it a different way to go around with less people , perhaps with less grain , but also with a higher quality of life , it 's
there 's one of my favorite life , maybe some of you , you know , is based from the subject of that subject , so that you have
and there 's a lot of technology , and i think , every single thing we use , the computer , the body , the coffee , the coffee , the traffic , the way i can make it so
in fact , i can make a better better different to you in a house , i can build the
to make a higher more , more than a little bit of a way to
and i think about other teachers , life has been done to be on risk per carbon , and we 're at what 's been done now , and that 's where we 've been , now , it 's quite deep to see the company
where are the need ?
what are the services i actually have ?
and how can i do that with a little bit of a little
and not with a little bit less , they 're not on , you know , they 're not
there are many examples that you can do .
in contrast , a building system has been built into a building ,
seven and the five brain system is actually there .
that 's basically what 's wrong .
you know , if you ca n't have any likely to have that , and then you have that kind of thing to do that , and then you have a lot of money , and you can not get a lot of resources with everything , and you 're kind of doing a lot of money , you 're going to get things at all the time with the
but also , it 's too much to our own , kind of , how do i really know ?
elena has a beautiful book written book .
and then , as i 'm looking at how hard it is , it 's something that is really something that it 's from
so , the power i want to give is the other point from , and then i 'm going to be in this kind of life in this
you know , you know , in some words that i 've been doing that i was doing , and then i
the most beautiful creature i 'm doing is you 're all aware of the data
when i started my center , a few years ago , we wrote that on a few
then you have to wait , and you 're going to have to do this on , `` you know , '' to call
and to write out of that is to write
and i do n't afford a lot more .
this is efficiency , and this is economic growth , we 're going to come back
but i did n't really get that time .
i had a little bit of a job job .
but there are good examples , and slow food , for example , that i really do the ability to take the quality and the value of it in the
and with a small group , a million more quality can
one of my favorite examples is power .
there 's been a recent class of the class now , that the average person has been in the area of us in germany , about 10
can you start with power .
who had two , three hundred hundred hundred children had a , have a parent , more
they have the ones .
we need to get out of that .
and increasingly less people get that to get all of this stuff .
and need a lot of reference that allow us to get involved with these little things .
now , i 'm interesting about this , maybe i may also have sound using the outside space of the outside , which is , i 'm not a few things
the next example is that if you have a little
a real theater .
star , honey , has been seen in some of the perhaps a decade ago , in a regular cell form in
in the meantime , there 's more people that are going to be more people , and
if you think about power .
urban rights , consumers that make just work about how to do the things we 've been doing this beautiful , which , a few hundred years , and still have been able to use the other people 's
so , what happens to be able to do is to use better
that 's a question of justice .
i 've seen it as a way to argue , you know , you know , this is the image between africa and europe and one of
so , in the way that all the same time that you can make these resources is possible , you can actually use less
and that is not less quality of living , because many of us have just seen it to have a lot
but it 's a critical issue of the economy , the company , these products , these communities , really , to have the kind of thing we need to create a good life of a lot of money
last thing , that has also been to do something with the great world of politics , is on the growth , is not what i
if you read a little bit of the experience , then again , again , it 's time to be able to figure out , and now it 's going to be the
it means , well , a crisis says about my head and also after what we 've been doing , very much with these things , and we have the numbers to have the numbers for , you find , you find , you find , for all the countries that are going down ,
and there 's no reason to have growth , to be the kind of thing i know from my childhood company , which is from the '80s ,
it has this been significant reasons that , in a
one at five percent growth is now as many as eight percent growth on the age of years ago
and the eight percent is what china has already today .
they 're also there , and we might have been started a hundred years ago .
in the area , if the average is bigger , of course , it has been eight percent of
that 's a percent of a female , and it 's still a lot that we
but you have to imagine , and you have to imagine , that 's not an even even even even an even one time if we 've had to get 50 percent growth , that 's what the next year , the way
we can do good food , and we can work with that .
now , this is not as good as it is not so hard because you know these statistics , the fact that growth has gone on it for the time they do
but the economy is growing , but the quality of life in it has been around in the world , and we 're on
and also , of course , too , too , too , without economic growth , and it 's not so deeply happening so that we 're not going to be called that and you
that 's just not true , and then you have to get the economy of the economy .
and again , it 's still going to happen and still that too , too , also , as a result of life , like a next week , which i have , in the climate system , a bigger
already , you have won that at the time that you have to be able to make in your life that he said that , that 's the good life that 's in the good world , the most
that 's why the end is , not enough to create the way that we do n't have to make the amount of growth in the way that our countries do n't
for example , for example , and these countries , also in china , for china , the most script is quite
and this is just going to start to look at the way that we 're going to grow through , and we 're just looking at that level , on that very high level , where we 're very good about it and
and it takes politics .
it needs to make goals .
it needs the whole way to say , the bees
it does n't just have to take growth , but we should really be and measure and ask , how is it that we 're actually on the quality of the quality
is the line ?
and then we measure our own politicians .
of course , how high is the consumer ?
how do we do it ?
we need a simple part of those is the way to have the animal at the time , not the
and who is really , who are really the characteristics of people , but also the teacher , who know very
what happens to control control , we even know , even a early early computer .
you could do it with a very different way
the resources are like , and therefore , the resources are getting up and not the work .
and you 've got to start all of those things to make all of you to make a way to get up to you to produce
that 's what 's going to happen to do , but there 's a little
that is , `` yes , more or less , to have a conversation in all the way to work on that direction , we can actually be able to ask the real products as a way to ask , what do we need , what is good for us ?
what do we need , and what do we need ?
the real policy are politics that the whales did .
some of the evidence i have to have .
and then , of course , of course , there is that science is not about to be 75 percent of all the time , and still
but unfortunately , nobody did nobody .
if you look at the same time you 're looking at the development , you know , the last 20 years , it 's always going to
politics does n't make the energy growth , but that 's the question we do with them , and is that we 're going to have a good life of them ?
so , throw it right .
so , again , if you 're going to get
with heart , brain and hand and the end of the will , we need to need it .
thank you .
i am not completely open .
and i love this city .
this city has so many stories to tell .
one of them had discovered a few hundred years ago .
and then we have creative to do with creative .
and i think , in these creative , i get the same one , and i 'm
it 's going to be to do with the computer level of
this is a miracle , right , that 's there in the middle of this town , and it 's a lot of these city that
another story was before .
it was taken in a hot house , in palestine .
a man that 's true to see in his feet is that it 's right complete .
that 's what he 's about to be
he 's a guy , he does n't know that with the heat .
he makes it a little bit like he 's wearing the bone tube , and he 's not quite a long time of a long , and it 's still
he 's putting the back again , his feet path , and he 's showing a new climate model in the studio
it 's the trick , it 's a trick .
and this number , you see here , the same is the same in the text of the game of the ball of the dung
one company is completely covered with four letters .
one of you is , or another of you .
he even had the original idea ever known and open up .
both have been made .
so he says , well , honey , i do my own company .
it 's about the fuel market .
today , today , several thousand and a half thousand deaths in this period are in more recent
so , that much like that for the subject
why not a little bit more challenging , what 's not there ?
and then , you know , the question may have ever asked the question .
if you do n't know , do n't know , it 's a chance for what 's a
this question that has been a lot of me ever made me in a hard
if something wrong goes wrong or my favorite piece of my life , or technology does n't work or whatever .
it 's true , little memory , it 's
what is a chance ?
and you get out of the space to open .
what that does is that you can do in a real place here with this
and another example was taken by the dalai killer of the world , and the actual point of power .
and the purpose of how creative people can be when they 're a little bit of a personal choice .
i want to show you a few examples here .
so , these are actually what 's been on the front of the day , and it made a bread that
i 'm going to turn it down .
my son did n't make the woman .
he 's just open up , so the woman is through the giant property .
or i had the whole day of men , and i was putting the tv down , and i suddenly suddenly suddenly i was in my mind , and i could n't see
all right , who 's got to be , is it ?
the circle .
they are completely completely .
i 've been grateful , and i 've lost two times .
you can never keep much off now .
i was n't saying that last thing to do with the crash
i mean , the young woman was in his life
if you 're a man , every more explanation is supposed to be done
but if you 're a woman , you do n't understand it .
so people are creative , we are creative .
and i wish and i dream that we all will use all of these creativity .
many of us are completely completely completely completely .
and that does n't have to be that way
why not so easy doing anything ?
so , ancient things we do are put up to the site that might be already or power , or the opposite .
why not that does n't make different things , that completely , as a little simple being being
and there 's so much common companies that are using this .
for example , you have these kind of power of your life , you know , these innovations , or the wall , for example , and then you 'll think of it .
also , a way , is it ?
so , let 's get to stay the coffee for the
or something like that .
we have no legacy to get rid of you .
is it just news today , right ?
if you do n't get the phone out of the phone
or eat it up at me , we 're actually fighting them .
but , again , it 's creative
that 's something that takes you .
i 'm going to give you a single person 's one of the kids who would be doing , and say , okay
so , that 's what makes you happen
a soldier has been completely open up the way of its current , and it 's in danger .
once the year , the present news , even the most part of
if you had three seconds on the front page , you 're totally open .
once , the report gave to eat a long thing to eat .
it 's a living building , and the bus was very small , so the players had come out to be the same
it was too busy .
they have done , common , what do we do ?
how do we solve the problem ?
we ca n't grow faster .
it 's a idea .
every single dot is , you can get rid of this place that you 're getting on , you know
so , the air mind in the long time you get your mind , you know , you could get yourself yourself
just so different .
a creative idea , and perhaps the power problem .
there 's one person who makes you right right right now .
so , this person is a number of fact that the most number of life , the
and still , the german bubble are the german .
already the second day that takes up again , four days .
one company has been raped with the support of the month , and they may have been asking what they 're
a key guy is a restaurant , rather , we 're at hand
people come to us at the face .
the birds are full , and it 's going to do that there are more and people being getting in a single bit about their own to a better point of being
but why not even something that can use and useful sense to something from his own life ?
sometimes creativity is also safe to accept .
and it comes from a mirror to be able to figure out what the company you might know about .
so we 've known that you do n't really have that well , but you have to save the space of the room , you have to have a little bit more challenging .
or , in terms of the car .
we know that we know the different ones , and all sorts of things are different
yes .
why not n't you be a piece of a piece of a piece of a stick to
or , to be honest , it 's also possible to make sense of the
and all this has done to do that with humor , with joy , and sometimes it 's sad , to be honest
sometimes it 's funny .
one of my favorite son was my office 's son .
and in this case , i 'm going to cut
so , we 've got several power around the power .
and then he comes from the left , he 's a funny , and i 'm telling you what you tell , say , this is not a problem .
he was looking at me , big eyes , and , i think , a great
and at that moment , i actually actually have seen it , right ?
why is that not a heart ?
why is that what we do , not the price of adults ?
and that 's a lot of stuff , right ?
if we 're a little bit , if we use our privacy , that 's what we like to do .
and with that , it takes information , but it 's
and this is that something that 's when a single day of the week is changing what 's going on in our
it 's the first day in the week , and it 's kind of focus on a different day .
so , like that , we usually have a lot of
so , in the same way ,
that 's what you 're listening to in the media .
at the point , only one day for the beach .
or if the most beautiful time of the year is , you know , you know
what are the rest of the most dangerous weeks of the year
is it so terrible ?
do we have all the awful jobs ?
a life had been on the board page , this topic .
yes , `` you know , '' `` then , you know , and let me
or on power , on facebook , everywhere in the social networks , this topic is called this topic
once i got to get the power of life , one of the power of
there 's a lot of business , and i 'm looking at that .
what have that mean to be in the field of what 's there ?
and one day , i 'm going to give you one day to buy this computer
and the first sign that you see here , yeah , that 's actually quite a nice thing .
so , from with this love to work instead .
i do n't get that to be father from five kids , but i love my work .
yes .
or , fast , for power , is the following sign .
why is that the color of the people who are in a degree of time and still and continue and are
somebody has once to have a response to this path , not the home , you 're your jobs .
and i even question in a moment with the pink guys to come here and say , okay , go out .
what 's beautiful about my job ?
the higgs thing is , even if it 's the hot flag , it looks all the way out of it .
so , here 's something beautiful to talk to .
the hot dots are going to be an end of the tissue
there you are going to have a wonderful look at the bottom , and you 'll put that
but to get rid of them do not .
where do we get that , when we do n't change that ?
in fact , the question to do is that , the content
within the company , it 's been a disaster .
it 's perhaps what 's happening in a system where we feel as a way to feel the
the mouse is going to go into this mountain , and it goes , and it goes , and , in some of the time , it 's going to be quickly , that this
what does the mouse mean ?
you do n't know anything else , it 's going back into that .
and again and again , again , the movie day , you might know that you might be able to get rid of the
this is beautiful to live here to the living room , so you can think of it as a great one , and it 's always going
and what we might feel as an funny thought probably the letter of a moment ago , yes , yes
or something needs to be completely completely completely .
i went to it in a couple of years ago when i was walking on a poster home home
and once , in once , it was the street that was able to feel that it was quite black in my eyes , and i 'd got to
the next day i went to the doctor , because i thought what was there to go ?
he was looking at me and said , `` no , is all right .
but how about the power of this ?
and i looked into my apartment to see that , and i saw three weeks of weeks , and i kind of got a job for the job .
after 20 years in the environment industry , the first thing that first in early early questions is to ask us to think of the night to the
i also thought , what is there still more for jobs ?
and then , of course , to come out and to get other people to see that i was with my family , something good to me .
open to you , if you do n't know any other , even any of the people in my career
i realized that the talk of time i have a large number of people who make me really
i 'm going to do as a toy and a toy and a way to give other things , but to get those words to be able to help experience that i am
and it was n't always that .
i have to realize certain of you guys need to have that completely smart
and sometimes , really , really , really , really , in the end of the day , there 's more and more later , i 'd say , it 's more than a heart , and it 's a heart of
and i said that when i said you to go back with me , he always follow me , you know , you walk with your walk
today , it 's coming on me
so , like power , it 's slow in the right place , but you 'll also get together to stay together .
what happens ?
we 're all going to be free in the
they 're going down . but a curve , the more , the fear of the disease of health health .
if you 're going to get to get four and a half , four percent in the last 10 years , it 's almost more likely to
rise of the u.n. diseases , it 's called 95
this is something i can think of , do it so that ?
why is that ?
is that just in the fall ?
no , it 's like that in germany .
it 's true , it 's all less healthy .
that 's kind of seeing that on the left .
there 's been estimated 27 percent now , in the bottom , to four percent country within the last 10 years , and a
the number of traffic accumulate fuel plants are getting away
the cost .
and it 's all kinds of probability , what can we do with this topic ?
so , sometimes , sometimes that gets out to try to get your own , like ,
so good , i thought .
and somebody said , no , no , no , no one solution to do
but what about the solution ?
what is it that what we do about more healthy and more and more of a time ?
and that 's what it 's all been true for the
i 've been thinking , are there like this , can it be something that is so much ?
i 'm not optimistic , and the job is not what makes us feel completely and happy to be happy .
there are many other things that are important , family , health , and so on .
but in fact , we have the most largest part of our lives in the work .
and if we do , why do n't do that is that it 's going to be joy and also to get it to you
i mean , i want to make sure that is based on to make it free to you as a last bit
these little sons you can get easier to see .
it 's also a design for art , freedom and environment .
that is , how do you i know that 's a little
in that environment , i mean , do i mean , do you ?
what freedom did i do here to do what i want to do ?
because , the only thing about the power is to get us to
the more of it , the more difficult .
and what do i do it ?
the effort .
that 's where four worlds are going to
and it can be a look at yourself .
i had to look at that for myself a couple of years ago , and i do that research again
can i use my favorite software code ?
what environment is ?
and that means , sometimes i 'm going to go into a box with my laptop , and you 'll talk to the crash
the freedom of freedom .
and i think that the freedom can take me to do something about me .
and i 'm also going to be able
the effort .
the last virus is open .
and then there are always people who are telling me why that is not .
and why is that much more difficult to do with you
then i really have a answer to the point of this .
who wants to find out .
i do n't mean , it 's why
and what 's the point of how you can choose with yourself , i 'm going to get it , i 'm going to get it
and you 'll have a very simple one .
what do we do about our ancestry ?
each of you has been able to have the big thing
that 's a lot too too .
this is filled with massive , with massive , with a lot of it with their skills .
what do we do about that ?
for the end , we let the question .
or when we 're in the hospital or we 're in the end of
what did i do with my privacy ?
by the way , the thing that you see in this point is something that you can see .
so , what do we do with our privacy , is such my first question , even to me , and every day .
is i good enough ?
and resources .
there was a little bit of a story about this story
i want to tell you about power .
and that is based on the point of the level .
this led was the more expensive for the most successful time in the stream for a while when they
and the dutch point that these were so well made that the way that they could n't do it .
flying walls of different ways that make life on the side , they have been made more sophisticated , thick
it 's been on the back
so , the thing that we thought , well if we do n't get up , then we build a
we do n't have to go out and down .
let 's just look at what you 've got to do with
they were made it from long after the day where the rains were almost used .
they only had one more power in the way to be able to get into the path , and to be on the power of the house , they 're going to be able to get that blue and
in addition to get you to explore , you 're on your mind , come on , come on and help us .
it 's the way with the power path .
and then , at once you see the police the list of the front of the computer 's the kind of a virus , it 's going to be taken down from
all right , think of a life , which is already .
it 's embarrassing .
again , a completely debate , on the wall of the computer , has been there , black .
depression think , oh , it has two more numbers , it can take something else .
at the day , the same thing is , he knows that he 's going to know that there 's a real bit there ,
at the end of the second day , after the six different circles , it actually looked down in a completely completely position
because they thought that makes us too long , that 's what we 're going to do at all of us
after that , i went down to life and you get on the open
one of them did they had and they have developed them .
these are the power completely gone .
i like this thought that this is all there , what we need , and that all of us have .
sometimes it 's all basic resources , sometimes it 's not much , sometimes it 's not a little
but also , we can do something about that .
we have no idea of power that we have the world to have a daily .
and if you think that might be a good thing to do , then you have right .
in the summer , the spring goes off
this is coming .
and we 're seeing there by the phone , which is there , there 's going to be down there , and then the plants are going to be totally
and there 's these types of these types of brain coming out
so here , here , here , here , here , here , here ,
there 's where we can pull there , we can collect the bread .
there are a lot of animals that eat that food .
there are people who are going to then take products to that later .
and it 's coming down .
but if you think about it , you might not be all likely to think that 's not that way , it 's a
and of course , this is a huge thing that 's very popular to be very popular , and also very , very effective , but in the area of the atoms that 's the connection of the
there are research that show that until there are more than 90 percent of our food , we do n't actually have to get food at there we do
again , that sounds like that is so cheap because it 's so normal to us , and we 're not going to be smarter in
there 's been a very interesting film for a while , and that 's also a interesting film ,
and i 'm going to put it to look at it .
but now , unfortunately , we 're looking at the word line of the moment with bees who 's working with the bees in their school , in principle , the meaning
so , that 's what he 's doing to do with a school at a school , and it 's going to
please , mr. .
yes , good evening .
only once , a big day will come from this , and all of that completely
i 'm going to project that i 'm going to make you a little bit with my project , and i
and also , even under a car car , a little bit about small points of what is that fun .
because i think that the news of you is that today , it would be now today to be a complete business of the world 's disease , to be able to get to the study
i do n't do that . no .
but maybe i might like to make them start to find this open , or a certain tool to develop them , to work with this completely , completely little bit of a sudden of the higgs field .
my name is thomas , i 'm 27 , i 'm 27 years old , a very famous woman , and father of five children do not have to have come out and have a different kind of power and central , and working at the time in
i am a member of a nuclear life on the main part of the world ,
and now , in terms of life , there 's these very totally that are based on with power
we 're working there in the garden , in the agriculture and the sugar .
is that it is a little bit of power , and it 's all about absolutely power
our next classroom is more a gene , an silence , a quiet thing .
and it 's also moving to a point of
it 's almost a complete issue .
and not so for free , the old soviet organization of the connection between these are completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely
and in a wonderful note of einstein , he explains how the power of power was to make his own life to the top to help him to learn that he can again
but the traffic you do n't really want to get you in the way , but they send you blue materials and right now , you know , the baby 's eyes and the right thing that 's going to be the same thing , and then
a beautiful picture .
hopefully me the last night of the evening .
yes .
the flying classroom .
i come to the project .
one of those pieces of life that 's in my students right now is the students with me built together with you for high days for high days
in those villages schools , we 're in charge of our school , or in fact , in the '50s of life , in the local school
one key after it is in a place that is to be in power
the teacher who put this project with me in the class and we 're looking for a kind of a power room for this .
mostly the window with the children to see something like this month .
and in all of the things that are the bees that then then there are through the sound and get it again .
and then , then , then , the window is a
so .
and then all of that starts on me , on the way .
so i take that kind of a power and a sense of a switch , and i 'm now now a little bit of a sand level of a
so important on that level , these are children 's children are using
also , we have totally , here 's a little bit of time , and here we have to be fully sustainable now , so
and then you have a power , this on top .
there 's basically one that activity is there
they need them if the bad move is in the place , and they ca n't fly
so .
so , that 's what it looks like
and then the space comes over here , and immediately , the energy will move in all of this space for this , or the space of this life
and now a little wonderful begins .
ladies and gentlemen that farmers in there , in the middle class , there 's an issue about this crisis .
their people are not anymore .
they 're shocked .
you do n't find your queen .
and that 's the most important part of the power , when he 's making this completely clear that he 's making the most the queen in the old
so that 's not what they 're not doing in these two
and you 're going to be sad to see these
they start to track .
yes , the essence is you guys .
you hear this .
they 're almost less likely to be a little bit higher than they are in their position with their mother
and now you start on a position .
ladies and gentlemen , in a night , now you have the need to develop a new person , and all this stuff is not any common , without a tool , without a process of memory , no memory .
here 's the people , and then you can see in the first night here .
because without the woman , if they do n't exist , they do n't have
because life is only about six weeks long .
so .
and in that first night , she was coming out a pen , a pen , a pencil , and then that 's what they 're
and that 's what the word of this is to be
everybody who 's been right in the prison , is he just going to be like that ?
yes , hopefully save , but all is free to get off of
that 's true .
and now a little wonderful begins .
this scenario , in the most industry of life , is a double charge , and then it will be a
the dome has the first three days of the genetic code as it called the marshmallow
after that , it 's the equivalent of a complete mass
you know this term .
and immediately , in this level , on this level , on the most genetic field
they are being changed by the way that they 're going to be changed
we 've already heard that before , that what we eat is what we 're going to do .
and the queen is really wonderful to experience .
so three days a little bit about five days , five
and that can all students .
that 's what you see in education .
and then , this cell is completely completely based with a skin and the whole thing , and it 's not because the people now is going to have to be economic to the product , because one of them will be , you know , or you 're a poster
no , that is completely completely completely happening
ladies and gentlemen , this is a real one or a life .
and then , after eight days , every day my students know , three minutes , so you will make sure that the queen of the united states
and the day that it would happen to you , the teacher has ever taken the head of the life of the life , and there is the dominant sequence in the front morning at
and then the mother says , `` hey , what 's happened to you ?
yes , i have to be in the school .
yes , why about that ?
yes , our mother 's disease .
yes ?
and then the morning at six in school .
and then they keep their real step on this site , because they want to be honest , like the queen in the u.s .
and if you really do that , please hear something .
this woman 's `` new .
so .
another bit higher .
and then the gap on , they have the queen .
the first thing that this dream , which is to make a sense of fun , and now with your life of these people , to a woman who 's actually met their own , her , her control
the people have now again .
now three to five days a woman sent this woman .
from the level of life , you 'll get your own security
then , the bat comes out , from the people , from this completely completely .
and after five days , this lady will see that this woman 's `` little
some of you might think yes , yes , i 've seen a life on the site .
wait , space .
what 's completely different .
-- that 's what we 're going
the queen that comes down with every single time without no , is that , from this completely completely completely about two miles in
you 've seen it already in your pocket .
in the environment and there 's something in a republic of that war rate , which is , from seven to 12 , 40 times
so , as in terms of islam , where the guy in the world , different women , you know , there is the queen ,
and the whole thing is in a wonderful way in the business .
the drone comes from the back of the back , and the queen is now in this original sense of all what they need to put in to the local and a half years to make
for the drone , it also is an amazing experience .
if you 're right with them , you 're dead , and you 're dead dead .
and then the queen comes back again and starts to turn eggs .
there are always one , two students in the class that goes back to the watch .
and then you see the queen immediately .
yes .
and then finally finally , finally , the project in school , because now the environment will be back again , and the queen and the tsunami will be built up in
and then i come back to this thing , and then , then ,
power is the most part of the outside , and the next morning , i think , i 'm going to take that kind of competition with the queen and
and there is the queen here .
yes .
religious security .
and it 's mostly 10 to the day of 12
and then this is , these two main power come here in a completely environment .
in a context of a planet , a single one in a single bit , and now , this will
why are bees in school ?
ladies and gentlemen the kids that have ever done before it never stop .
yes .
there is n't just that that in this class , the students started all the time with the bees , but the whole school is there , in this class , in this class .
and the teacher when he knows something that he can do when he 's in a little bit she has something that the first thing he would be doing to take a first story
look , bees and selection have been a given time ago , we have been discovered where people have already been able to have the
a few months ago , you found a new newspaper in israel , and you have found the bees , you know , the bees
there 's a human culture with bees involved .
or the other companies have been done with each culture .
in china , in india in education , in egypt , in edinburgh , in private .
everywhere they were .
the human cultures are ladies and gentlemen , are meeting .
he can get a pen , a brand he can have , he can turn in a
ladies and gentlemen , you know , what are companies or trees who do n't know ?
you know , there 's something that you see today , now in the summer there ,
that 's where this is a green space for our bees .
yes ?
he can go to the students in the 1930s , and then there are hundreds of thousands plants , and the hundreds of other plants , and the way they go to the bottom , the way they
how long have you been on the person ?
and how long do you take it to come back to that ?
he can actually have a fake environment .
how do i get a stick ?
yes .
you know , if that 's that you 're essentially the top of life , or you 're at the top of the top , or is
look at this right .
he can be math , or , a life response .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , he can actually find the way to the police effect on these power .
and then he comes to the question , how could write of coffee nets get the bed at all ?
because he used the bees to see it in the stream .
but , ladies and gentlemen , in a wave , it 's actually complete .
it 's a picture that looks out there .
and only to the professor , which has been considered many years in a place that has been essentially aware of the most significant research that the bees are going to get a completely open on
like a complete web from the park to get a battery , and now with lower surfaces , you have some kind of place , and the bees that get it down , the ball of their legs , with their power .
do you see what these bees do in school ?
it 's totally more sophisticated business , and the kids are losing the fear of the bees .
and then we develop that kind of power for bees
they learn , honey , whatever the bees do .
and you get a little bit more likely to get these things in just a just way for humans .
the bees can not even have a $ 1,000 million people in the year .
before , in the course , a lot of the same way
they 're moving off the trees outside at the bottom of the trees .
this is a real power , and the blind thing you want to pay out
now , imagine that in the summer , these are central -- they 're actually not making bees on such a light space , about free degrees .
hey , there is no innovation .
no , i do n't know .
because they have moved natural natural gas .
they 're making the pollen , and they 're like to play it down , it 's going to open it up .
someone who 's a life that 's driving is , in fact , the power of the can be able to open up a brand , and to put a brand to a brand , and it 's
of course , there 's a typical field of time , and with you with a space of life , and so
yes , and then i start and i start to know the other things in the way that the bees , of course , and we had less of the same , and we would have less , if the bees go down , or we 'd like to
there 's a lot more than this .
look at the power line , there is that much faster on the most stage , where the dead stops .
and then the bee goes on , they will come up to their traffic and the whole light
and now the cow comes in and you will stop up the way they 're fully fully using on top of them , they
yes ?
and then you get that again and you 're saying , `` oh , '' i mean , `` oh , '' i mean , `` ah
and then they got milk .
that 's what the result does .
yes ?
and at least , the result of these is the kind of most obvious thing that we have on nature .
the key .
i want to come to that point for quickly to move .
my students feel at every year , if they 're going to build this life , then you have that kind of thing with
now , this is not what i 'm going to do with the fact , but i had a student to do that , and i said , in the back of the school in the back , and i
and then he says , `` well , i 'm hot . ''
i come from you , and i 'm for 20 years .
and i 've been in charge for five years , and for two years , obama 's death system
and i 'm pleased to tell you that i do n't have to learn to learn to get to this , but with that hands .
it 's true , yes , with your head .
and a life went through the wild , north korea .
and more than half of them said , oh yeah , we want to .
my students are like this kind of amazing justice and the world between , in my heart , the more glamorous , the more vulnerable , the more
on blue side you can turn and you get out of the way that my students and you get
how do you get to the building ?
the question is wrong .
you have to say how do you get to the power of that balance
and i think i 'm going to do that there is the person to be more and more of a new life .
and he says , `` well , start with it .
at the end of a little bit of view , from power
the way the sun would have that the sun feel like the sun , the sun is , and never to keep the kind of the way the kind of thing that 's going to happen to the very low way ,
thank you .
hello , friends in the world .
so welcome to my project .
the project of my person and my wife .
it 's the fight for a end end of female .
in my eyes , the largest nation of humanity , because it has been since the age of the
society has still been the other people , and over the other time , they
so first i can imagine you .
my name is subconscious , i come from santa .
and i 've done it to my own years .
you might think that the job is not open up .
i felt i was not complete .
and that 's why i was so happy to make me a good good in the subject of this topic and interesting sense
for example .
with a huge amount of power on the sea of africa to brazil .
on the grass to turn it on the top of the empire of the world , the highest island at the last powerful county are
this was a toy , where i was more more comfortable than being more than power , more than power
and yet , these would be able to have to think about the interest of the media and even a small person that i could make the most part
i mean , i 've got with with pressure with living characters in new
then , at that time , there was the war and the museum , and we were surrounded
and despite all of the people that we 've done , we did n't have the most famous cultural vision of the power that we have all seen , western cultural
and so twice twice we were able to put into them and our two characters that they see here , with their bodies , as a living ball was what they were with the body , and the journey of
if you want to kill the demand you 've just given to get through
something happened in no other way i found it .
and then at the time , in the young days , you know , well , you know ,
and also , the blind you want to be able to be able
for example , the power .
the department of defense , it 's totally
but rather than the real people like , `` social responsibility are doing it .
that 's the values that it 's worth to fight .
so many years ago , i was again in this room , and i was in this room ,
and we then hear about this rich female , we heard of that
and then , when i heard that the most of the people in the daily group are the ones that are effective , and they are based on the way , are they going to be a kind of balance like islam , and also
and the idea was to get the highest government from islam to make the need to make it a need .
we did n't have that phone organizations in the sierra african organizations , we did n't
we had to start now again that we were going to be completely completely completely completely aware that islam was not completely completely
you 'd be able to let the phone phone
on top of these diseases , we have a power of our own organization .
and they were in power and get in their own
and to do that , to get the peace of all , we do n't need
and that was a real task .
and so , that 's what makes you and that , in that desert , i 'm going to put these
the bad news pictures i 'm not telling you , but i want to get the whole thing to get in
girl at the age of four weeks , and then , at the way , to come to the office and the family of the world , you come to the floor , and you sit on the lines of the lines , and you 're looking at the lines of the street , and you 're looking at the air , and you 're on the
what you 're going to do is a single bit of a collection of
so , amy 's now is a decade
if you vote your rule , you 'll put them two weeks .
so , interestingly , in the body and the body , he would
that was the beginning of mind it 's completely completely true
in the meantime , it 's going to continue
the man has to open it up .
he never saw a little woman .
the conversation that i told him , oh , be a problem , but it 's not
you read your studio with your heart , and then you sell it hard to play
and if you do n't know , it 's not bad .
then you take the sheet of paper , and you cut it
that 's completely completely completely completely completely
and then , there 's a third of the
this had been used three months ago .
recently , the girl lost his language .
these are the power , too few of asia .
most of them are limited .
and when we asked our companies , why did they do that ?
and it 's really what we do , that 's what we need to do .
nothing in the koran of it is in the opposite .
every dot is at least five times every time , like a percentage , the vision , it 's perfect , it 's
but they seem not to believe what they 're talking about .
they 're forced to be a real place , and you 're kind of being true to your own , and so you know , as a real person ,
but now we had the images of the first telephone age , this is the
it 's also given us to make his whole completely completely completely true .
there was heavy events , two days long .
but we had the health paradigm on our site , the highest rate on our side .
and then the great decision that is great , the conversation against all the human rights is to religion , we have to get it
and as a first time , this is the kind of thing that
and when you know africa , and you know , you know , it 's just that people 's doing .
and it was being built and those scientists , and then we also started in other countries
so , very short example , there 's been that the first thing that 's happening with the first stage , which is the power of the country that it 's a crime , to write a crime , to
we used to get rid of the way to get rid
a hundred of them we have done .
and where we came , we just have open up , open up , and the most beautiful , british architects .
and when we wanted to leave the country , we would say the big minister of paper , and we 're going to get out of them ,
so , there 's no way that 's going to be in
he 's right .
i 'm optimistic , and there are so much going to be slowly here
and most importantly , he had an idea .
he said , `` if you 're going to take the person to get the 10 with 10 to the world to make a table , and to explain that to the needs to have
and i went to the store in which the environment and i have in the far far way with the famous
and as you get most of that for life , that 's the power to get you to the top of professor
he heard the idea about it was deeply about , especially when we could make a piece of what we were going to be .
and this is what we 're going to do about the keyboard that people
and then he said , i 'm not going to get rid of the time just as we were asked it , but i 'll get the most visible thing
and he did .
over the course of law , we 're making our priorities in
international security to the average is of the power of female body of the
under the power of it , professor luther led to kill .
and everybody is coming .
a hundred of them , but the highest of the world
in the middle of plastic , the man has open in tanzania , and the rest of europe is the key of the power of it .
so men can get life and kill their lives .
but also , the other .
on the left of life , on the right is that power , my
the average world in the world .
i 'm just going to make a lot of time to make me a little bit
and then i did all of them .
it started started the conference .
and beyond our own level of life is from the left from egypt .
the power of life is based on the lower rate , is from the essence of the woman and
so much , that 's a much more , islam is not being
we also had students who were able to get more open on their way to their own , which is terrible to women in the form
and then basically then show their movie , completely .
reality .
the men had locked up .
they went back to the way he looked at the other two hours , and they had a kind of a body of a
the power line itself , the cameras , most of what you 've got for .
and the most important one thing that happened .
female jazeera is a life of land that is called against the highest side of islam
he used to support the air bank
we thought the job was done , but they did n't have the best election without our grandchildren
because the lesson of talk about the head of the woman is more than everyone understood .
that 's why we 're completely completely
we have this one and we 've been in this conference back in this test book
a key to the police workers in the world .
and because of the way , `` amy '' of life , it 's so well that it 's so well , it 's a book
it will be used from the hands .
we were in many countries , and we had to put up some countries with the number
and they were reading that with interest in the same way that they did this book .
unfortunately , most of the most people who are going to have the courage to do this is
over the edge of the woman , you ca n't talk to the rest of
just some have the courage .
they 're at least all the schools went on .
and sometimes some of them have found some of the most profound moments that actually found in the conversation of this matter
and then it 's all about these channels to the power .
and these are the people who are being the
they 're going to pull it down
but i 'm going to go through that time
they 're all under the very home of hot tv , and that 's why i do , in many other ways , this
the need is a little bit
but my favorite thing would be that .
i want to tell the great message of the highest world 's largest academy in the front of islam , '' here at the near
not so hard in terms of power , but in fact it 's not
if there are four million people living in the other day , men and women have
then i 'm going to turn with all the one that 's on there , and the high king my life will
i 've already been talking about in the position of life .
unfortunately , i 'm not going to be the last puzzle that the most matrix word
but i 'm sure he 'd get with it , he would be in .
one of these women help to help .
to show the world to show the most real values of islam , instead of the way they 're looking at all the time .
by terrorists as a power .
if i do n't , i can do that , i might do what in prison has already been before before
because at least , you know , at least all of you , in
and we could be able to get solar out there
and perhaps i get out there that the little girl could do their teeth to do .
then my life is worth it all possible .
and i want to keep attention to everybody who 's already known , and it 's seen to be able
but not the other is there is a power effect
we have to talk to the conversation in the jobs , and even there , i do n't even have that yet
and now , i want to show you back the design of my life , you
that 's my favorite thing , my life .
and this is all in the place in all the places in the middle of the name of life , and i have
there we have , in the middle of the hospital , we
female jazeera is with the head and the destruction of islam .
it 's open and a combination of islam .
thank you .
thank you .
so , i start with that .
and so , as a result , the power of power , which you put as
on a position of fact , my mother has my brother , my brother and i have a chance to get a
it made something out .
my mom was totally depressed because they did n't understand why we had now share to the kids .
on the third day , we were finally going to
we were able to put this stuff back back and then again , and then a little woman and just put it out completely
and they tried to explain to explain to us , that can be food
that 's not stop .
a very good thing .
it 's a second thing .
my mom was in the upper high high life , and we
`` ha . ''
in my country , we have the only end of the wind , but it has n't
i 'm a completely fan of my own .
and i was with my mother and my mother , and my brother , my brother , was in
and that 's what i 'm talking about here , and
but , most importantly , i think about that , to me , to make the people that have been able to have this kind
but first of all , i want to tell you where i 'm coming
i am not alive .
now , the core is a little bit of the fact that we 're living
and this region is going to call the exponential area by the chinese .
it 's about 90 miles away from germany .
china has 10 million of them in china , but in its own life , in its own life ,
and this public life , because we have to address in china under our mental laws .
hundreds of chinese have been taken to have been so close to place in our own home .
our own language , they 're literally created by the education system .
in schools , only chinese use only chinese .
and our religion is not free to design .
the national player is losing your culture and identity .
and if somebody is being lost , and for the right at the right , they 're doing , for the right of
and that was also the reason that my parents decided to get to us with kids .
that was completely completely , and i was at the age of age
the picture is just about our trial .
we did n't have enough money , so my dad had done before .
i 'm not making me to make a lot of people who have done us on the train
i 'm going to pass with a lot of pictures
i 'm going to pass with you first to get rid of this power
i just show you the same thing i was talking about when i 'm wearing my
he was a big demonstration of his life , and then we met him and we did it with his little little little little
the first stage was built .
i know many of you know , a little bit of a little picture of danger that is only going to make business weight , and it does n't really
but i wish i wish i needed to call him a bit more open , not as a power
because it has a lot of people who have
he stood on the war at the age of life on the war , and he has to see until the last end of the final end of it
and president in asia we 're going to get there and i remember my mother somehow told me , kind of out out of the war .
do n't get it .
until we are out .
because i had a television party in my hand , and there was my photograph in there , but there was a tremendous name ,
i had to get rid of the power .
and i 'm not making myself to the complete level of my self 's hand , and he had my favorite
silence .
marketing .
a long one .
we have been called this .
in fact , i had a lot of time , and i was in a lot of a lot of
i 'm not going to move to the very low woman who has been used with us .
in a life of four pollen , 65 families are on top of
at least , at least children
a power and a stick .
there was some russian faces .
and many different languages .
and we did n't have privacy .
my mom , my brother and i needed to share a difference .
there was just been , and they 're getting , and
friends do n't come to be just that because i am , where we were .
only my favorite favorite power of life in the male community knew why
they knew my story and i made it very , and they got me to me .
for example , she brought me to completely what i do n't do anymore .
but they also helped me a kind of einstein that they were in
i spent my entire shoes in the space .
that was just easy for my mom 's .
alone , with us , we 're not children with the guy without the guy and we always die of the effect of the activity , because
i 'm on to make sure i was very , very painful at the time .
it 's also a little bit too difficult to tell me here , but now i just need to be my story .
i was very successful , and i could go in to focus in the school .
and we had a first time that we had a very normal place , for the first time we were able
i do n't need to have a normal word from the way i kids who do n't
i 'm also making the power to get the most and my brother to the brother or their brother .
only with that , we 're just running
i 'm also making myself to make a few of them that are not completely aware of what we did with our homework job ,
or they just kind of cool .
we always have very happy .
i know , as we walked down to the level , and we 'll keep up to these people because , somehow , it took a random people 's random people , and that 's why we were
after two years , my father came to germany .
the problem was that he was wearing right of his own life , because it was n't the place that it was in charge of a life for
i 'm not taking me to the very , very creative insight that it has done to me , my father from the place to china in china , and it would tell us that he had lived in their own lives
i 'm on to make a while i really been , very , very quickly , because after six years , we spent a normal state of a nuclear school .
we got a live room for three years , and we finally finally finally , a little bit of a book , with a car
and i had even a room .
it was very small , and i had no doctor , but it was good , i could put my door back .
and i 'm not going to make sure that i do n't have used to do that , and i had to leave the bed without a meeting .
i really was n't looking at me .
and then , one thing that i 've been doing is always used to be around in my life and still and i still have to do that i can actually get to
first , then , the power is true
i 'm the teacher who believed , and i was really not being the time to put it even until to go to the middle .
i came to get it .
and before i get to get some of the life , i came to see my best friend of
power is an organization or a project to be the project .
but i was n't good enough , i just do that because we could get a place to make a place where we could just walk .
we had a mission of what we could find our intellectual way .
and the head of power really taught us that we could tell our problems and we bring it up and could tell us anything in the same way .
and then i got to open , totally .
and this is a project where young people without a while without the possibility to get rid of the way .
and that really did very well , and i realized , art is something to me as little .
by making power and their own , a dollar dollar came on us .
he did the film `` literally '' about my friends and me .
and the film was a lot of insects .
we realized that people were interested in our history .
he was a very interesting feeling , because we 've never seen that people have forgotten .
and this was a moment i thought , okay .
i do n't want to get away anymore
i want to make something from my life .
a quote of power , a power of life for cancer , came to me , to a collection of power of power to completely completely
but i was totally close to the distance building building , i was talking about a power for a play , and the name is completely one to four .
so i was right right .
i played with .
and the great thing is , after a certain , i think , that after a certain , two degrees
and i asked myself if i just had to make them own them .
i thought , wonderful , ray .
i mean , i mean , i mean
and i was doing it for the street park , now , rick is rising up and one of my favorite favorite , where i was also being an operating position for the european world
and i actually won him to that .
i study on the college school for most of the university , and film it 's in the third year and is totally open
and all of this would not be able to be able to do me if not any single or organizations like or how would be a good thing for
they tried to have me open up me , and they made me a way to me , as i could , in the form of a way ,
and i 'm going to come from that to you .
each of you has the ability to get people like me , and to get a chance and find their lives or their place in the society .
because , the people , facebook , come up with several hundred minutes to get to the other , and each of them are full of hope , and each
they have been working with large , many great moments of the time .
and with these phones , they might really be a big quality for high and for every single one of us .
and i could actually tell you a couple of things you can do , but i do n't have any time to have any time in the face , and i 've had a fan of them ,
and if you 're going to do your phone , you ca n't tell me that they ca n't make a
so , send the code , and then come on the side of you with lots of what you can do .
and that would help us all well .
i 've already been doing that for your screen and we 're all going to be away with
and then send the code ,
i 'm a believer .
many people have not done the phone out of their hand .
are you so hard , right ? what ?
okay .
thank you .
true .
only one more profound event .
and i 'll tell you that we 've been playing
my name is called ray .
my favorite life is easier to come ahead than you 're talking about
i come from a truck . this is in 1968 .
i 'm very much more interested in danger today , in danger , it 's really beautiful .
i 'm going to have a lot of that in a
and this is not an analogy , this is a feeling .
yes , yes , to do that , in the other part , i 'm not here to be here to give you something about
i do n't know what .
but it 's so that i write music in my own experience , and then you can talk about this talk , mostly with power or in the same way that today is .
yes , and i was asked to read here today , and i was going to read some of the text songs to make this the
and that 's what i 'm doing here .
yes .
i start with a joke .
you can get two hot .
so , he says , `` two english theory are now all i 'm not going to follow you and are not going to get rid of it , but basically , i think , a lot
say that other does .
parents just explain you with me .
here we have the problem .
the first text is a little bit of a piece that i wrote .
i 've had a little bit of a person who was doing me in a person that i
it 's just complete a wall .
and yeah , she did n't understand it at all .
when your head was in my apartment , he was leaving her entire entire book .
my leg was also under my studio , the ceiling 's leg .
my leg was long through the ceiling .
it 's about your head . it 's on my desk , the rest of you under the ceiling , my leg , it also looked at the ceiling , it 's the leg outside
this is completely what my leg looked like for .
it was very embarrassing .
the next text i have been , in the back of a person that i had a very special
and i 'm on my shoulder .
we have no longer doing that .
my favorite book was a passion for him .
as a child , he 's playing love with love .
i 'm just like this . yeah .
yes , you know , a child text
better than that .
so , the story is the only thing that 's going on the side of the lake
but where was god when he got to be saving me to move this thing to the
is there you think yes ?
i 've been looking at my own life ?
marcus : video text text
the next text is a little bit more .
he 's actually making a few hours .
so , to write .
read faster faster .
and i think it 's a novel issue that i 'm going to do with a dozen of
ah , it 's about real , so the status of a guy who 's always moving back into a hand , and then the hair , and a little bit
i 'm going to move on this point of view of the mind i 'm going to do
because i did n't write the hair .
second one .
if i 'm going to open my head up .
as you get empty , like the paper , that 's trying to fly to
yeah , i 'm not coming .
very hard to give you very much
the next text is a little bit of a life .
most people understand it .
i 'm going to make that hard .
and that 's what i like to play with my plan and my language .
i always had to leave her with me with me .
and then , then come with these things .
it 's just complete a wall .
is a little weird thing to solve .
is probably something that completely completely completely hurt you wrote .
so , there 's a lot
yes , we were off .
and all you can do that
we 're totally open .
i just want to ask that one
but i can .
i can do it .
i do n't .
yes , i did n't understand it myself .
no idea .
yes , i 'm sorry of myself .
i always say , either , or not .
the next thing also has a little bit of what to do with
it 's kind of like a little bit of
i was going to call that back for insects .
very successful .
yes , you know , a child text
is a little bit of power .
and that 's true , always , and when i 'm going to make you so that your
my text just plays , all good things are cool .
so , bob 's getting to get rid of
so clearly seemed to be illegal .
so , you have to have , click , click , and you have to be , and then , and then you will
nice a little bit of a
yes , even lower life , which is a time that is another time
and that 's just cool , always than i say that we 're all going to make all that kind of a way of doing it , so we 'll try
right , so this is what the wind is going to do .
the text is `` raw , '' and this is what we
yes .
so , to thank that .
the actual text is just a sentence .
i write that what i call is little points .
this is a cold facility cycle .
solar is called the essence of the power of
marcus betti
yes , yes .
so , to thank that .
yes , you 're running off with your
that 's basically written in its own .
it 's a long sentence .
i think it 's almost impossible to explain in fact to explain in terms of the fact that is
here 's another text .
this day is a live .
it 's called the name of the text
this day , a brand is alive and he knows it .
he already knows that before i put him in this business .
he was going to take me his head up on the moment , he would just let
i 'm going to completely completely completely completely being able to
i made him the joy .
it 's a demonstration that 's been able to put it up at all the days
with a typical toy in the face , what you have
and to stop on , it could not be a bit of a more to
and i would later , and i would like to play it again , and not to do it , not
what about hope , right ?
now , it 's time for a little joke .
what was the first thing that was great , when he did n't have
i was talking about .
so .
letter of pain sounds like the cow .
that 's fun , that 's why
yes , the next text , he 's learned the paper .
is something political .
so , i do n't just write a little bit crazy stuff
i 'm also hearing a very political way of political stuff
and that 's what i often want to ask with you where i 'm on
and , yeah , because , because , because , because , because , i 'll
he 's wearing the name of `` the
my father came from me , and i was in my mom and i .
yes .
if we had that power .
thank you very much .
yes , at that point , i wish i like to make a little bit of
i ca n't afford a business business , or anything , i have to make it more to make
and that is to say , i 'm also in the moment and i 'm going to give you to a
can you show me .
and i 'm optimistic , and i 'm really free on it very embarrassing .
and , yes .
i just want to say that .
it 's on the program .
more advertising .
this is a little bit sentence i wrote .
michael feet .
rich of them are vitamin c .
so , the power effect .
vitamin lear .
already funny .
i want to write a joke about the number of your friend , the most arm just was just flat .
yeah , it 's not even my favorite thing .
so , according to the point of your mind , the standard empire is actually going to have to get to
yes .
thank you for listening to hear .
you have great .
thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen .
let me just start with a simple question .
why would you be able to do something about
i think everybody who 's going to have to ask the arm whether he can get in some sense of some kind of thing that
the answer is quite clear .
we now know that life life has gone down at the time , only at about clean percent consumption .
that means to be able to make any kind of model , make all the impact on
why do n't we know that much ?
why are we being wrong from statistics out of the power that will be based on ?
you remember , 14 years ago , the soviet union found .
it was fat .
and you thought , if you 're flying out out of the food , we 're all the windows of the food ,
what you have in power with is something to be with different activity in american terms of u.s. , which is what 's happening about , and what 's happening in it is
then you have said , `` ah , no .
but not the fat .
it 's the blood vessels .
and then , then , then , then , then , then , as a matter of the power of
so , it 's going to be a very clear thing that 's going to happen
how do we get all this ?
well , the reason is to say , for my sense of this moment , we 're using creating these very unique times , in the process of
in particular instance , for example , for a life rate
the most opposite you 're all familiar with
so , basically , a lot of more sophisticated a lot of
the top rate of life is based on the next year .
larry ice was seven years of life on top of a light station
then , the queen died was the
or this lady here .
morton bast
the most man , the gulf of the earth has lived on .
let 's have been more than 19
i know there are many people who are saying they are in high , but they 're not in their lifetime of their lives .
but tom is actually completely complete .
and she stopped on to smoke , but with power , to stop a little bit of power of power to follow and stop .
with power , they died .
what does this tell you ?
not that julian healthy are healthy .
but it tells us that feynman is very complicated , and that we need to make enormous amounts of data , we need to make the simple , kind of
does very simple question and a very simple thing that has been sold in different countries is women are older than men .
what is that ?
we know it now .
so , that 's what 's going on in the ground , what you 're going to do
and there are absolutely very simple evidence of all that are really simple to get the same age as
now , now , now , now , can anyone care about yourself , is that a
in fact , a force is a force
but there 's even more amazing to get the other way out
we should be asking us to be able to get to do at
sounds complicated , but just to get normal to the normal to prove .
so , in the end of someone , somebody 's making me right on the ground and wonder , what did you do like that , or different , it
ah .
the richest department has 10 degrees centigrade .
now , that 's the secret of your age , is n't
and then the ten rate , perhaps , is n't going to
or , you 've got a distance , and you have a conversation , and you could get the
even hard statistics are not more effective .
now , for example , i mean , really , very hard to ensure that people who are in the dark will be older to be older than people who do
art .
it 's blowing away .
is that being on the power ?
no .
it 's because people just have to put away money in the back to their age , to do their age and to do the real health .
but if i can take a group of paper to spend a power , and those two percent of these two percent times more than the fact that the space has not been not , but they were not going to be the same thing , and then i actually actually have a
and in fact , these are just like this ,
must you say that , in fact , it 's very , very religious , but even i 'm with my decision , it 's that now you have
and this works for a whole bunch of different organisms
for example , for example .
you see here there is crazy power that 's happening
if we were going to show the ball of it in the blue line , it would have
the same is true for power , which is where we 're using the time and recently , about two years ago , in the united states , it 's even
that 's not about being flat .
it works in power of the university .
and this is another experiment that was made in the united states .
what did you do here ?
you have , you know , it has been totally given with it , and it has a kind of weight , and it 's a complete diet where you 're going
and the point is that the symbols are being depressed , and they did very awful , very bad , and bad lights .
now you have a familiar , you have a sense of analysis , and you have the same number of activity that the same number of it
they have nothing to eat , and they would n't be eaten in the past days for so
and that includes is now there is a protein , and it 's healthy , and it
even though men are using their own neighbors .
both have been eaten in a lot .
one woman and the other costs .
what 's going on there ?
it will be a process of liquid activity or a real bit of
whenever you 're living together or save , then , the organism , the organism , the organism , the organism , in the cell , to be able to move to
that makes sense .
and this looks like this .
you can see how there are actually totally totally complex to be totally common , to be a certain person who is alive during the
and then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , the blood layer
so , just in the age of the age in the sun will be
this is the primary function of the activity , or the power of the most often , often talk .
so , to put it together to fill the life of life in many different organisms
and it 's probably that this is , to start , is that it works with
and we learn that they 're not like , you know , not like in fact , to get any little thing on day with 10
no .
but , you know , they 're supposed to say when they 're hungry , ah , maybe they 're the sum behind
you do believe for your own food as a friend
and that makes you all very common .
while the total point of nine , nine percent of the history has given the person who did it , if
right , he 's been left .
we 'll have a lot of back to the eyes when we have to grow
and that 's certainly the biology .
now , we know , of course , we know , of course , that 's already in the bible , in general 's mind , the mind is dead , but
the blood is a different thing that is very different .
here 's an indian power rate in a local color .
the three brothers here are the good ones , the food day , the whole day , the people .
and that 's kind of a completely practical thing to
so we made this looking for looking at the search to the search , the economic response of the brain , even though of the
that could be interesting for people to be in fact not necessarily enough to be completely completely completely
and it might be perhaps perhaps that one of the most difficult power of life is
so the question is , can we have the power to come in , the bottom line , the bottom , even though
and we 've been doing many hundred people to come up with the thousand , natural ,
we have an idea of it called open .
is that it is a matter that has actually seen you in all these different systems , but it 's also in many places that
in the skin it 's completely completely completely .
people have a lot less likely to be in the skin as a life .
and if we can get open up on human cells , for example , look at that .
this is a sound flying cell .
is the power that is focused on us , and we see many thousand of these little areas in the cell form the most vulnerable , which is being on the age of it .
so , as you get , life cells would be
and this works in many different organisms .
here 's a power for a power .
so we have a serious insight of this , which is the biological resource that is
live because the organisms because they 're too longer .
and the answer is , again , you see the same thing that you see here , the
it 's simple power .
after most successful , everybody died after long , about half of dead every dead .
whenever we 're going to put into the water of water , here will be a lot of the animals that
we also know that human cells that we have made from high space systems in culture in which a three times more successful than we do with them .
and early research also shows you that even life is going to be spread by all the way of life
and not only life , it is also the danger .
these are totally completely visible .
so , so ,
now , you want to know , you know , all of us know
and as the name said , it 's been discovered by the muscle , it 's coming into very high levels .
but i can , you know , in an extreme religious green , green brown box , and a product of life , which is being on japan 's great , which is completely , so , it 's kind of competition
we then said , if power is possible by making it by making it , to the extent of it , is it even possible to be
you have to know that the common aspect of all is that the common aspect of all is that the `` is '' in the
and we did have experiments in the same time .
they 're going to wonder , we 've done that on a distance .
and then they 're also more sophisticated , if they 're old .
they have more power in the brain when they 're old .
and the russian communities that are interested in memory are very similar to people as humans .
now you ask yourself , how about the bottom of the bottom of the memory of the memory of the
this is the experiment that we did with a nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear school .
they take a hundred hundred sensors , and i think they 're going to put a little bit of a
it 's true .
and let 's finish that in this position .
then you take the same fly , you put them into the next slide , and you 'll give you completely completely completely the other other ones that you
we 'll make it completely a bit , but they 're really aware of it .
`` spanish '' is power
then you take the same fly , you know , that is where you 're
so , you 're going to go into the front down here , and you see
and when you 're on the bottom of the bottom , you 're going to get away from the one page and it 's
where do they all go up ?
you know .
the results .
except the two one .
that 's the power .
or , you know , they have the character .
i love my favorite life , and i do n't have to have a sense of sound that make
okay .
but what is a funny form of the site that grow with the age of
not just fly .
and we actually actually have the power of the fly on a open open on a power , on a open , more open
and the most expensive thing that came out of the brain was being depressed ,
that means , it 's not just about the informal , but it 's not about power disease .
and this is important because we want to be not the most expensive to do the high school foot .
it does n't make sense to write time .
and i do n't want to leave you , without you still , in fact , to give a few more detail of what we
again , you get extremely close to
it 's not about you 're making weight or anything .
there 's already a group of people who have been able to get some group of people who had a day and a day
this is the way that control control is actually under the outside of the rise of the wild
and that really thought that 's very good .
that is , it 's completely .
they 're going to be completely
it 's not about using mechanical complex objects , not dangerous at all .
it really is about scary .
you know , there 's totally clear to be violent , to be alzheimer 's organs , and even when they 're
and you also know that sugar can disappear in the growth of atoms .
here you see the emotional field of the time itself around .
after 30 days all of them , all dead .
it 's very small from the male atoms .
to create a power effect .
there 's just one example that works in almost living organisms .
eat out the food and the vegetables .
it 's going to try to be the same kind of power or not about
you know , you know , that 's true -- and not to cut
that 's not what 's happening in vitamin d .
we 're actually talking about here in the winter , because 80 d will be able to get out of the skin by ocean
some three times , at least three times per week , half of the hour , that 's
now , luckily , about the russian level , they have only cost 10 to 30 years

the impact of the video and blood pressure is a light on life .
because birds live almost as long as women .
it 's true , it 's being alive , it 's more
life lives longer than power .
but life is still more longer than being more than power
only only is dying about being a power .
what is that ?
people think that has helped to do with a more act .
no , no , it 's just easy .
so , if you 're going to get a battery on the back , and then you see that , i
and what happens is that in your traffic room , right
totally matter , power and look at that , you know , in fact , you know ,
so , it 's been a very common effect that 's
a strong partner is , or a family 's a little bit of a
you do n't want to live on a much [ a ]
now think about that .
but that 's not something that happens with power to do anything
it 's all about its head .
you can actually measure the same time a lot , more , and you can do more power in it .
and that happens , when he says , i used to make my mind .
i can just sleep in a minute and the sound would n't make me anything
absolutely not .
he 's still more open on the blood , and it 's bad .
climate change should be limited because of course .
we now know that there are some very good effects that are really very
and most of the things can drive up .
and we also know that labor is , and we know that we 're also
and the knew of our childhood , our dreams also had us with power and so forth .
do n't necessarily sense .

in fact , a beautiful study of mine showed that this was a given to an least a show of a small visual child a day can make a difference on the level of
and you do that , you know , you know , that 's the
there are studies that are showing that there are studies that do n't show .
what is clear is that cancer is getting completely able to make up to the tissue and make their own interests
and coffee is actually a good thing to do with a good thing , because he makes a sense of how we could come to a universal
and it 's very beautiful and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more of the thousand people who have been made for 100
this is a huge value for me to have a tremendous value
and this is true for depression , family , mental , power , power , power , power .
but not for the older hand , it 's actually quite dramatic .
the only way you 're going to have to do is , by the way
but , actually , that 's what it
so for the sake of time , that 's
the next thing is a little bit of a bamboo
and so , they 're trying to get the shot of a lot of more material , so from meat and services , but only when they 're between open and
and what 's really interesting about new of the study that you will see when you 're to take a lot of more sophisticated molecules to make you so strong your way to your power , when you were
that is not for the time that these cognitive parts are still about , and it 's not for the most of the most clinical kids or a thousand , the more dimensions that the more and it 's not doing for the

whatever you do , you 'll have to do this with a lot of time , and you 've never seen , `` the muslims that '' that i 've been told , the most game

this is the name of `` the name is '' '' for about this amount of life , and he 's been made for
he comes out of my home 's life -- never been sick .
and he 's going to go very well .
he 's not a complete place not the other story , but it 's alive in a space of space where there are a lot
he 's taken about the power effect that i 've told you today .
we should not be able to do the actual experience of the kind of thing that
so , that 's the basis of your mind , that the bottom of the mind , it 's no way to be a secret ,
you 're open to the old people , and that might be one of the most expensive mistake of our
so clearly , the largest mile of the power was a year by the death
the daughter gave up .
a work where the latest wisdom of all is mostly the conventional hot field of all
thank you for your attention .
i want to start with a question that i 'm going to do .
a question where now nobody has to do is , because that 's a little bit of a state who is a familiar ?
the societal industry is very small .
smaller than i thought .
but it probably does n't matter why they do n't have any more common , but the people who would not be there to be that they
a lot of people are getting around and more and more and thinking about
that 's not the case at all .
so , in fact , now , now , now , now , now , now ,
maybe it 's too the case they do n't have any sense to have the question of being in the same way
if you feel yourself , you 're laughing ?
you can be able to feel yourself without being able to be able
and you can be careful without being able to listen to the moment in which moment
now , i 've been doing a lot of time now
and that 's also that you have in the front of this time , as far as
so , frank goes in the era of the present and the
now , frank takes time .
and that 's why nobody 's in a few seconds here , that i have them to show you .
so dafa-alla is power .
so , it 's estimated that time to be aware of her .
and then it 's also also to make a sense to talk about that
and that practice is not available to us .
we do n't have the language we have hope to be ourselves to see ourselves when we 're talking about ?
there are two two points of life that i 'm always going to be on again
and that 's a part of humanity , you 're from the beginning of text .
from the day you 're at death , you 're actually just reading .
there are few moments of moments where you can get that power .
and these people go to the often , and they 're often moving all day .
i do n't have time . it 's so much .
and then people might be less at less of the people who say , everything is connected .
so , i really do n't really do that , so i 'm just a part of the big universe .
and there are the great group to me , as well as the way that i see , the time that i
so , i think , okay , today , i 'm angry , and the next day , it 's all together with all .
so , when we think about arkansas , we always had a big deal in the very big
the department of the main field , the arts , the main driver 's license
but through these christians , about these large power , i do n't talk today , but i want to talk to you about the little , the most expensive position , where we can be able to face it in such a
i do n't want to talk about that in the way that i want
so , in other terms , it does n't really have to get hard to us with us
the german railway colleagues have made some pictures that i 'd like to show you .
how much it 's always been to think of it as we can see
we do n't know if these people feel really understood in that moment .
but , who do n't know the moment to do that in terms of what 's so much you think about what you think of , you know , only in the corner , and not going
and all of a sudden , there 's all of that
maybe you have already seen some of you today today .
what you 're doing is that you 're going to do the phone that you 're very often , that you could today , in this very well , that 's the right thing , that is ,
quite ironic when you look at the screen .
what we 're doing here is not doing here
yes , and then there 's the historical , and then there are the historical , who are waiting that you 're sitting on to get a life on top of you , hundreds of , you know , and you 're going to be
that 's the essence of the blue thing you see from the outside
we 've heard other people .
but i 'm sure you 're also there , and i 'm also there , as you know , there are people who are told you that the day of their pain feel like their whole life has been so powerful , by trying to get
and there are also people in this room also the people who are asking , because they have to be a different person , because of the death of it , of course
and there 's also nothing that many people , the people who are connected to that , to them , are they feel their text .
and there are people who have been able to be lost in themselves with no longer , and that 's why they 're playing .
i 'm going to pass that the digital vessels .
and just the top was their front up the cultural opera
the cultural frontier is familiar with us .
these are people who believe on their opinion , to be a separate of social values
well , that 's pretty much more .
there are no barriers , there are no longer high number , when someone has any human person than not .
and we think that the old people come up with you
it 's the potential form of the alphabet .
since we 've been living in cities , we 're all living with a lot of people with facebook or on facebook , or in short weeks , or
you can be connected with hundreds of people without being connected by a single person .
it 's more likely to be more to the rise of human relationships that are missing to the digital level of relationships .
the two forms of the new are really often are very often to
that 's also the case that entropy comes up with a little bit of a plastic
whereas the digital maintenance went out of power and their own .
it 's about being limited that the digital sphere of the future is more more connected than the possibility of being connected to connect .
i do n't know if you 're going to be that feeling of that sense of being in the future of this sense of being something that 's
or whether you find that it was a new thought of thought
but these are also the problems of the fossil generation .
almost bigger than the national self is the fear of the arts and from the fear of being some other , people are being ready to do some things
so , interestingly , the great power , also a real person , has written a real life .
in this sense , what people do is not alone .
they build a lot of them , they liked kids , and then they get back and they
but this is not something that you do n't have to dream about fear to the fear of the city 's time
flying gaming .
things were deadly .
so , the process of that is where you have been looking for : because it 's very much more likely to be a little thing that is
problem is that it 's going to be used very long and it 's going to be this starting to
so , therefore , we have to buy a new way of making us
i have seen the advertising portrait for a complete explosion of a life system .
and the power completely completely completely about mobile food to the original model , which is what it looks like
what that means in terms of is you do n't know , but it seemed the same thing that was
so now , there 's nothing to do with the control of the control . so , there 's
totally , it 's totally a wonderful poem , and there 's a little bit wrong at the worst time , it 's the
hand on the heart .
in a relationship or the other way , or to look at the back of the back , and suddenly suddenly suddenly to feel in , you know , terrible pain , and the question of question , who
i mean , do you start to do anything ?
it 's a study that the most successful women would have , you know , the supply of the food ,
because i do n't know if i did n't know if i did n't know the study often , i often have that i told them .
but , it 's very hard because it 's not the least at study studies , and the reaction always always believed that people are in me .
that 's kind of a kind of thing that is so much , almost a
so , to b is a little bit of a moment , and yet we do
now , this is a little bit little about the size of
well , that 's probably everybody in everybody .
even while you 're wired to think , what do i actually do ?
who is that person in my bed ?
and also that form of einstein not necessarily necessarily what it has to do with to have the quality of the building stuff
there 's nothing to do with that , to do with the quality of
it 's just always there .
we do n't talk about them because we do n't look at them .
we do n't talk about it in the gulf .
in the gulf industry , the arts is also true as we think
i was doing so heavy , and i found a group of five , better , and i 'd say three feet of paper and two were made off
the two men have been learned to have the two women in the field .
and in fact , something is something that something is a little bit with the power in the hand
i think i have to keep the right answer to you , so that you have the kind of thing that you have , you 've ever seen that in your education .
it 's the historical state of it .
but it 's also the ancient of the power .
we all know about the life line or i see , in this point , you may also be able to get the
in danger , in the garden of it , in the garden of the brain , often that often do n't know what they 're actually doing what they
where they are , where they 're coming from .
also , a form of happiness is not going to be talking about it .
only as it is to be true , how obesity can be been produced as a permanent
so , romo is here in the
i 've heard a complete note that he 's called , he 's called a train , and he said it 's a little bit more time , you ca n't imagine it .
a life was alone .
so he 's got to open up to the open home
and two months later , he 's too high .
the stone is never finished with that .
it 's always coming into the connection with other feelings .
she 's beautiful , beautiful furniture , and she has low relationships
the most basic news we all are seen the
fear , romantic love , despair and the beginning .
but we should not forget the beautiful .
the freedom of happiness is to get the desire to get
so my favorite message look at the stage .
come on , you 're in the living room .
let me go and do n't let it just by your own .
because there 's something much more than the opera , and that 's the dark room that you might have all of the time you do n't get there .
so now , rio is part of life
since i 've been thinking , i 've thought so hard about it , which has been thought
one in my favorite studies i 'm not going to have to do not like a red tour of my time , i realized that i could n't call someone of the way he did not have a parent because he thought i may have been more comfortable to
i 've been doing it since the time since i 've been writing the high school department since i 've come to my life
that 's exactly what the players you 're doing is that you 're like .
well , there i 've been too high here
and people come and go to the system , to get out of a button a heart or a relationship .
when i was a kid , i found a lot of
they can do without any power of the probability of any time with someone else
whether it 's in the wild or in the economy .
each time it took it to sign .
as a child , i found how i was going to
as a young scientist , i was really making an incredible thing to make this thing to make this
but , since i was in the moment , i was able to put a lot of myself with the ted stage , and i 'm going to go
you see , as god as being , as a as , you 're going to
thank you .
yes , thank you very much .
i 've done this three moments of work .
a power is a battery . it 's a brand
and now i 'm going to ask you to talk to you , you know , you know , do
most of them would decide to get rid of the power
and that 's a really good idea .
and why ?
because we use the biggest impact to the biggest effect .
in health , we do something differently .
and that 's the kind of thing that we 're going to do with the biggest effect on eight and help
we 're going to choose to design for the example of the space and the line
but big , huge , it 's great
for me , that 's not so valuable .
or we 're going to choose us to get up
that 's what we 're for aids
also , big but still do very much .
for me , that 's not so valuable .
and i want to tell you today about how you 're using this for the moment of the biggest
if you 're to use with power and health , you do n't get to the subject .
and the theme is called the sound line
and the most important thing was n't been done in germany in germany , not the way that it 's in
and then the number of the deaths went in germany .
and i was wondering , what was there to be in the neighborhood ?
why was it so made to the end of the end
and then i was working , and i 've become a lot of a
because it was basically an case in the year .
what was there ?
there was germany coming up .
and we 're going to always be there and more
and i went back .
it 's coming near germany to germany .
and that drives a lot of noise
and in the year , they 're still going to take the curve right now .
and what 's going to be next then ?
so , as it 's open and open and behold , and how that 's all
and we 're going to always be there and more
well , i did one and a half .
because it was , you know .
julian 's hit .
and of course , for example , i 'm not here to tell you that cartoons was being raped .
because that is not true .
but one thing we 've seen together .
the lines of the new organization is that we do n't have to come to the way that we get to fight and
so what is that ?
the food system ?
and there 's also been really great study of the states .
and also , that 's the problem with noise .
and they have come into danger to this .
and then they wanted to look at me , what 's going on there ?
and you saw people actually have less and less and less of the people , but people are still going to be less calories , but they still still .
and this was revolutionary .
and that 's why they called it open up .
so , what we can explain to that
you need to imagine the body like a power .
so , we got this crazy big line here .
and on that side , there 's a clear , because we do all the way that we 're going to do .
and here is the energy as it is as a power
now , if we now are more sophisticated here in the environment , we 're able to be able to measure the power of the other page , and we 're going
human body do n't do the same age of age
that can be the energy going .
and this is in form of a fire .
our greatest ones are completely completely open .
but what happens is that when we have less , that 's what we have to do , energy is completely , and yet you 're going to get the
it 's got growing up faster .
there 's no life involved in there .
we are just mobile phones .
and that 's what happened .
our grandparents are still about to 2,000 miles per year .
and we 're now today today , on a few miles , and that 's the positive fact .
there are studies that are coming to be five to five -- to be 25
i 'm going to make you something with that a little bit more what i call
do you want to leave me to the chair ?
henry , do you get time ?
henry , mike is americans .
he 's smart , he 's not going to talk a lot
and he was in the study with this trial , and he 's now now
he 's in this typical diet of food , and he 's operating there , and he 's got a life
and mike kept less and less and less and more and just get more complicated , and yet it 's always going to be bigger
why ?
because tesla is still blue .
and i was looking at how much movement was called , like the day , and he was doing it like a report in the back of the pocket of the pocket , and at the
and it was a thousand steps of play .
this was the distance that was the distance , and the soviet union on the left , he 's the morning the car , the car , the car , the one of
and he came to a couple of steps .
this is called the day of 10 minutes of his legs ,
most hours and hundreds of minutes was raped in the morning , or
under this movement , in fact , diseases .
and mike is not that being slowly because he 's too much , because he 's always going to get energy and he 's going to get energy of it , but it 's not using a lot
and first , you get energy , as you see here at its power .
but energy is completely there that wo n't do .
they 're going back to their own .
and also there is a real bit of real and practical equipment and easily quickly quickly .
so the blood boat would have
so , when the energy gets to the blood , the doctors are talking about high and high space .
and that link , which is the way of the place , it 's like a little bit of holes
and one happiness , there 's still all that up and then the kind of thing that is happening across these little ice ice , and we 're talking
and now , comes from the heart is under the same building , because now , the blood is , it has to light blood through these light bulbs
and if that stick then goes into that kind of power , it 's also in the body .
and if that happens in heart , then we call the heart of heart .
and if that happens in mind , we called the computer project .
and even in germany , every second thing in the heart , and the
that means in germany , every second thing to get in .
and then slowly is n't that he 's not so sick of it , because he ca n't get a more more , but
and if you do n't know that kind of thing , then you 're always going to look at
for example , for example .
i 've spent a dozen time ago , i 've been able to call a nuclear diet , and there 's some kind
and if every book only is a friend of paper , and we would actually get that here , and we would have a high high public public systems .
and i read the time for them .
and there 's a lot , and that 's really important when you put more energy into it , you 're going to be eating more food than
and if you take less energy than you 're going to use them up .
this is microsoft .
but why are we need to get through this ?
that just makes you think of a movie .
but , of course , it 's huge .
because why were a cure to a hundred percent ?
because it 's a diet , and it 's not a
what are the stories that we do here for three weeks , and here we 'll be five weeks of weeks , if we 're going to start to fight it , for this to , back in the
what happens then then then do you go to five or seven
nothing .
but despite the fact , and again , again , again , a kind of a life in the business business , that we do
so , you 've got to get to any new diet today , where you 're going to be able to ask you , and you want to know it in your
yes ?
and then , then , then , then
and if no , they just do that .
because if at the end , it 's been finished enough .
it 's the economists that are worth whether we 're sick or healthy .
it 's the bad learning learning that we 're sick .
and it 's the good economists that we 're healthy ,
and when you look at a truck and look at the mirror , it looks the result of his
when you look at a gentleman , it looks like a couple of music .
and when you look at the mirror and be honest in the position , it 's a matter of what it is .
because if he 's more bad weight , he 's in the same way he 's in the heart .
and if you 're called a musician in the future of the climate change in your goals , it 's your memory , it 's not going to
then , just to just do it just with just more effective terms
and a study of simplicity is also a great example of this that person has a strange animal .
and what 's called , `` what 's a , is that , a matter of a matter of a space is made out there , and it 's all the
and at night , he 's building on the couch , and then he got to get to the
so he 's moving into his life , and he 's going to put into the line , and the one rate is that it 's a little bit more abstract , and then it 's a little bit like this , and then you 're going
and my boss would have just that way to them so much .
that was the people who had the idea of being done it
and i 'd say , `` cartoons , you know , for people who do
and somehow he 's right .
why do we have to have in our early and do the same thing we did , what do we
in addition , we have to do a lot of a couple hours of more hour per day
and that 's a lot more little than making the sun again , where we lost it .
it 's a tree tree
and so what i 'm going to do is to teach you a deeper
and you might know , you know , the situation you 're looking at the moment is that you 're going to go to the bottom of the day , and
and that 's what you see in this gap in that gap .
we always want to keep the elections .
we plan to our clients as we do it all kind of a way
we plan our whole life of all that we do n't have the kind of thing we 're going to do with where we 're going .
it 's a very different way of view .
that 's why you 're going to fly the space of the space of the space and the sun the sun will
i love for example .
and i 'm the only ones that goes out and down and down and down and down and down and all of the
but if i have already been there , i 'll be on there . i 'm doing it for time
then , i think , in fact , i think i 'm a movement that has just been
and when you get the root down , you 'll have to get married , and i say ,
it 's going to be
that 's about three times 10 minutes .
and a study of more , you know , if you 're going to get the more day more of the day , and you 'll get some more likely to go back down , and
that may be quite little useful to do that
but as a chemist , as a smile , i think almost a couple days ago , we 're going to speak about four ,
we do n't have that in our body .
and you give me a metaphor for me , and you do n't know , i 'm going
the americans are crazy , who are what 's going on .
this is a completely brand of five pounds up .
so , i think , i mean , i
only with that , what happens is that there 's little steps there with these little
and if that 's the effect of this piece of information , what they 're doing is what they 're doing , if they really are in a virtual
and these are the power that are going to get you down here every day in your
once you 're in charge of you , you 're running on a day , you 're going to
and then , when you think about it , and then you have a little bit of time ,
then they have still completely completely completely completely .
then they 're still getting faster and more more and more
but they do n't even keep their health health on a period of time
so , they do n't keep their health on their health anymore , and they do n't even
because the most important thing to do that is now that you 're going to be
and i 'm going to make a complete lifestyle structure .
and for me , it 's more than a living culture , for me , it 's a kind of thing that at a clear decision , it 's a kind of choice
because i think health has not to do it , what we need to do or do n't .
but health has to do with what we want to do .
and so i 'm just going to do a sense for them .
do you want to do that today just just for the best one .
and now you 're just know how it 's happening .
step step to step .
thank you very much .
so , what did a book of life actually actually actually actually actually be in such a big , weird way , and then do the world with
and so , in the way , so far on the conversation of being just just looking at that time , is it
so , could we still be today ?
now , does that might be able to do with stones
and how do we get that power and we take it wrong to our future
so , let 's talk about the question of what we do about innovation ?
you know .
technology research and development even the spread of the government 's most name of the government .
so , you know , right ?
that 's all great .
and we can be very proud of what we 're doing , and we 're very proud that we 're going to be based in that many of the brain that our whole whole work are all
we have a big , cultural population of oxygen developed .
but what about the future ?
what challenges are there to be a society ?
and who actually do that in the world of the great world and social challenges ?
so , it seems like to be the kind of mind to
a kind of choice .
so , the economy in order to help the most important challenges because of the people , the big deal that we can then grow back
and that the world is better to think in the most successful organizations and the people and the leaders and the market and the company , so in the company , they have to get the impact of the order of
at least , you start to have
but who says we have all that needs to look like that ?
how would it be because if we 're going to move our lives to make social policy and
when technology groups also also have cultural innovation ?
if economic groups also also be social innovation ?
if we think of individual and doing on the same game with the solution to a big conflict and social challenges
if it comes to other other things , and when it comes to us and we put it in a very different , right
because what was that ?
both sides of them , what is a company , is
can that be done ?
ask you may .
so far we 've done that always as a result .
fortunately , you 're the most vulnerable examples .
tony 's favorite brain has been with his power , with its neighbors in black incredible , to make the poverty there .
and interestingly , a lot more more than the real power of what the government has done in .
and he has been more than a variety of a variety , but that 's why to
so , the chance to go with me is that i 'm going to make you feel with somebody
i can imagine mr. measure .
stick on the very internet young guy .
great , it also happens to your own arm .
and so , absolutely completely completely .
i like the true .
and if you see that , then you think of really real , because of the day of the day , we need to make our future to worry about
yes , i think , as a result , he 's working somewhere for a lot of time with one of our power
it 's also very good .
that 's what 's called it completely , and it 's also very
and yet something else happens in it .
so , he 's not going to be a little bit more than not that i 'm in
so , this starts out of the bat that he says
so , again , we are all about power
and that 's also what he 's like
and he also liked that completely completely .
the right there is that there 's a real bit of power , and that 's what
so , not that he knows it personally , but it 's not like that , he 's telling him
and since the middle of the t in the middle of three , the never knew he knew
so , the more that he was surprised , as he was , he was interested in love with
as a bird bird , we
and when you had a car designer , he turned it into a little
so , the great joy of happiness , with young people , are the ones that he had seen his
and the two people have found these kinds of people .
and then , always , more and more ,
how would it be that if we just just have to get out of one of those examples of the two
so , amy means , like that 's when it comes again .
what is the difference between power balance between power to move with , and what 's going on
i did n't have that idea that way .
so , yeah , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then ,
so , `` you 're saying , '' you
traditional markets , these are more products , are serious customers , making some structures , there 's a
and you can also give in a little bit of the kind of a little bit , where the
and even crazy sounds , even though it 's very popular , that 's also true .
so what is a real life ?
so , `` well , so , `` well , you 're going to have that one thing is n't even that , because it 's not
it 's something very different .
it has a completely different character .
because it 's what you have n't got anything
no successful drugs , not a fixed person , nothing is known .
so , with that , a life is a profound organization that has to look at the order of a business model , to find that cancer is a brand , is , of course , that 's where it 's been
and you 'll understand that there are , of course , there are so huge organization in such different ways , different different ways , different , different ways .
yes , that 's what i 'm sure to be
but then , what do you look for me ?
so , i 'm going to ask that to go out and get it out to make me to make that little bit
so , i have a chance to make sure that , right now , that 's the same male computer found , in a while , you
that 's called completely open .
you know , you know , how do you make your company and you get your own life
oh no .
is that real ?
what do you think if you start to start with the end of your life , what 's happened to you ?
so you 're going to do a job of a kind of a thing
what happens to your mind like that , how do you know ?
and we 're also looking at it . we 're even even focused
so the statistics about life are not going to be a very sea perspective , because , because there 's an image of the world 's number , a lot of years ago , and
money is always the result of a successful company and a good piece of islam .
well , money is a power for the network of this kind
and it 's all the way that we have all
but it 's never the goal of a company .
yeah , what about the goal ?
the company ?
so , if i think about what i 'm saying , so , i know , without a goal , no way to do
and so , in fact , goals is always going to be right right now in some way
and if i did n't come there , so you know , i 'm going to do something that 's not something i 'm doing for me to do with
so , that makes no good sense .
so , i would like to do that because there 's a thing to do that , and then you get risks to feel that
yes , mr. welcome to the moon .
but i have a lot of what you 've got for you
a coral .
so , that 's basically right , so almost on a secret .
successful collection of generation is a generation .
a power for a gps system is
so , how do you know today ?
is it that makes me , right ?
so we always say that .
at venus , russia and market , and closed systems ,
so , to make sense .
i think that i can give you one of those .
okay .
yes , thank you , thomas .
but you just are going to look at that .
so , you know , that 's the important time you want to ask , you know , in
can we just come one time on the other hand , that i would make it better ?
so the first question is , what am i here to do , what i want to
yes , `` well , you know , there 's all you go around yourself , which is bigger than you ?
what are you going to do in the world
what do people have when they work with them ?
what are you ready to get ?
what are your ant , perhaps be true of being optimistic ?
why is this important to see that ?
because that is also your well-being .
and how did we learn from that ?
if you 're going to build a ship , do n't put the men to the same work , to get the whole work , it 's about the same to you , and we
yes , good .
so i just looked at the next questions .
what is my life on ?
what does that mean ?
yes , you know , `` well , you 'll pick your mind on
and these were used in the details of the details , but in fact , i 'm going to do you to get a little bit of them in front of you and
do you really know the story of the yellow ?
i 'm going to go to a chance
not ?
khalid .
so , step on .
so , you 're going to have a phone ring
okay ?
does it work ?
so no , no street elephant .
meaning ?
no hot elephant .
you know ?
so , this is what we 're going to do when we focus on what we do .
what 's actually the only possible way to do ?
and then what about that ?
yes , sure , you 're going to get that out , what you want .
so basically , you know , it 's real or the sum on
but let 's just get there .
by the way , by the way , what about me looking for me
i got to give you a piece of a date
and the other time , if you 're a power
power is based on the hidden board of your book .
anyone ?
at least , viruses are based on what 's wrong on their death , their death rate are
i suspect in the most part of the world , i suspect , is that the time to me , you know
i 'm going to make the glass in the front of
what makes real life is completely completely getting to get rid of
and i think of what 's been on my life life in the
complete brown mentioned john smith .
oh , did you have to have the evidence of
so , as a result , you know , these are great , you know , is based on
totally close up at the time
it 's a really interesting thing about space .
the real thing is that the real purpose is that they
and what does it look like ?
did you notice what it did ?
has anything changed ?
okay .
okay , the game itself .
okay .
so , then we look at this again , now let 's see what the market is .
and the real thing .
power is based on the hidden board of your book .
anyone ?
at least , viruses are based on what 's wrong on their death , their death rate are
i suspect in the most part of the world , i suspect , is that what i 'm going to do
i 'm going to make the glass in the front of
what makes real life is completely completely getting to get rid of
and i think of what 's been on my life life in the
complete brown mentioned john smith .
and what 's going to say is , how do you
so , i know , i was shocked .
i was really shocked .
when i first saw the first time .
i thought it could be not a thing .
and a lot more than i went through the head of the head , could i have the whole time as the area ?
i have my life .
and , okay , i understand that that makes you totally sense .
to go down there , the high budget system is that we need to move most of our perception and our own airplane .
but what 's actually going to happen ?
what is a sense of interest , and what is i doing ?
and therefore , you say , you 're going to have to make your perception of that object somewhere , which is more
well , yeah , thank you , we 'll be able to ask that to the next
how could i actually get to my goal here ?
so , that 's what i find my most good question
the lesson i 'm looking at is this one , and i do n't even know anything to
yes , so , in a minute there , you know , really good news
that 's easier to keep you more likely to do that .
because if you 're clear your own to your own your mind , your brain is able to be able to be able to be able to have to be a bit more , and you
almost contrast .
you do n't get different at all of you to look at a mirror in your own sense that things is looking
and that 's why they 're the most famous position that you 've got in the back
and even more serious , i 'm going to look at the point of the eye , and you 'll look at the right time , and you 'll look at the kind of time that you might ever
and you also have a big model .
the whales have this great thing .
matt was doug by the time that not ever heard the other days in his backyard .
to stop , to the most famous big table .
and that 's completely different people .
so scientists , blogs , politicians , professional , cultural engineers , architects and he has been very smooth .
but not in our most important interest , where do it go , do you know who are coming in ?
who is right ?
but it 's also that suddenly , from these different things , that 's how no one has been so much of those things that you could feel at all
well , yeah , the next question is , what 's the same time i do ?
finally , there 's successful signs of the reason you 're in the best
instead of doing big and more , and more , and so on , they just just stopped on the next step
because what do you want to do in the area of a matter of
but the way that we have , the way they do , is they
and if it was n't , they 're looking at each other time .
and even if the big ones are being totally likely to do , it 's going to be the same
so , it 's important to say that you 're your idea .
that gives you the dark security .
and in the same way , what did we learn all of this
although we did n't know , did n't know , and did nobody have told ?
now , you know , you 're going to be able
so , this particular learning learning , this stuff , and this brand dynamic is also also that fun is actually making it in a stream .
and that 's also the kind of cool thing that the kind of thing we do about the indus level that we
yes , thank you hate energy .
so , that 's not what sounds like .
but i do n't know , i know , in the company , i think that there 's a lot of things that i have to do something like
and for some reason , here in germany there is always such that kind of extraordinary
and i think that there 's going to be the politicians for this to do this .
okay , my boy , come on .
so , here goes down to the water .
what do you think of like , how many people are ?
ten ?
sebastian ?
ten million ?
let 's look at this .
who do you see ?
that 's exactly what i 'm
that 's the one you can do , you can actually change them .
or to say to `` the mayor of israel '' to say , `` look , change that you will be looking into in
do you think beautiful words and big matter , but how do you do that ?
so , we 've got to get some more power on our power .
in any sense of belief , if you feel too small , or if you 're a hard , you have all with you to do with them .
and if you ask you to these situations , what you 've now look for you for now is you might take you to feel a way to feel you up
so , for example , you 're wondering what you 're trying to do with yourself , about what you 're
and also , finally , to the end , for example , what you really actually see in the most important , or what it 's bad
so , i mean , if it 's already there , it 's all about .
yeah .
bird is a lot of thank .
and do you think that 's going to help me that ?
yeah .
and you can notice two things in that .
first of all , the way for a public person on the very field of life is to make your
because that is what your perception does .
and second , for their own , do n't look at you .
because that 's how you like to your other people , your own people are
the future is always only when we change our own perception .
are you going to be that ?
yes , i think that 's already i guess
so , i mean , you 're going
all right mentioned is completely completely there
yes .
what do you think about our desk ?
nice .
really , or , is it ?
and how do we just think that 's with that number ?
is that a new wave ?
i mean , yes .
all right .
i mean , i see the eye . i see
power is called something called the speed
and this is what the main kind of space really did .
a collection of the ship from the highway .
and so no , i mean , new space , you
that 's basically completely true .
the only famous word , in the same hand , is completely made for
by robert jazeera , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
let 's just just get that inspiration in the new .
and who may know that from our chair , we will have the next state of our
you 're going to see me , i 'm a
so , i would be a problem that i 'm working with kids and the future because , finally , children are our future .
instead , that 's the view i 've been making most of time .
i 'm going to spend a part of my life in
four years ago , my father and i could make the program model of design for the client ,
we 're just invisible out of the time , so you can be able to make a look at the details of the room , or find the details of the room ,
why do i so just so much to me with the order of power so the way that the ones are made out the
far not to understand the program as easy as the same way that people have to do .
and i would think that the most part of the last place is that i would be working .
what do you think is the most important factor in the childhood and the people who we work with ?
we found , it 's positive stuff sometimes like any other matter .
and if you think about why it 's so many , many numbers , so many of the caves have been gone to be because of the father that he had no good work he had a very good deal , he 's getting to eat drugs or
and if a very young boy is thinking he would think he would do something that he might have no idea of what another life would look like , because it 's not a better role .
and he 's doing his father .
i 'm going to make you more sick .
martin is the first of our program .
his father was a commercial and the whole family was the whole thing to hell .
when he was a kid , his mother died and he and his little brother had to go to her
there he was the sum of the big .
he was a shy designer , and he was making the perfect person
until that day , as a little brother , a little brother is so rare with a game game that had been so rare that
there were a first time in the first department of the first time the forest forest had taken through , and he went
and this day , he was able to get the
and so it went out .
violence is like the same thing that 's been on its life , like his father
how do you go with those who i 've described to you ?
after childhood , after the age of death , there are many religious therapy ,
you do n't know much other than your current security activity , and your power is
and then you 'll be able to put people to prison , and they 're going to put it right here , and they 're doing that same thing to do the
what do you think of like , do these people go to when they sit together in prison ?
usually not do a lot of good stuff
and they are better able to reach their own muscles
they sell drugs on a higher level of time and plan to the most waiting they could be able to live on .
and that 's going to spread in germany 's , from 95 percent .
that means in germany , every single state of the male 's family will
then there is people in prison who want to change .
but these people also have an objective on their hair .
and there 's a complete line .
and everywhere , everywhere , that 's your first identity .
whether you 're looking for a lot of a debate to be able to look at a window of a book , whether you want to spend new countries , and you want to do a lot of relationships , and you might be able to
that 's the problem we 're going to .
how do we try to solve this problem ?
what is the brain that think they 're going to do a lot
they 're going to be surprised .
they 're more sophisticated abilities .
you know , who has a place , have a sense of power , of power and from power
only at the time of a subject , it 's a little bit more likely to do with it , not
these properties , for example , are that these properties that
we 're going to start our program with a real education system , in three systems .
we 're just using the combination of creation and the economy
each people 's writing writing their own vision , and each other will step out in a
and then we looked at the people that are focused on the end , where they 're focused on the board of their personal relationships and also being on a kind of
what was going to happen to do with a program ?
it 's a big range of building , from power to space .
we have a life of that .
a very large amount of stuff and that makes you what i 'm going to do
so , as you get out of individual content and his mystery of the long money , it has been very early
he always had to have a business job ever , he had a
he 's been a way to a very long time .
and this was not particularly unexpected for me .
in the opposite .
he tells you today , he 's got his second job on it .
so , it 's been a little bit of a time ,
he just had a very , very part of a hard , and then it
and then he learned how to use his own art art .
he 's been born in the september of september , and then he started his nest factory room .
the nest maintenance works , it 's going to happen to this place
he had done very good work .
he 's now with me here .
i like to tell you to just like to tell you the
i 'll even talk back to that one time that i told him to talk about .
martin 's been able to see a education for a education in his childhood , and went to a couple of the
and there are yellow and drugs that are coming on the horizon , his whole was very fast .
he was working in a robot and a bird .
for the year , i was going to put
and he says , today , he 's talking that he 's going to have that with this local thing
and one day , he 'd almost like anybody 's energy , so he 's been able to
he was making a completely part of the power , and it 's actually there , it
he learned how to make the more power of more and more and more of the lives without the way that they could be able to fight their suffering without
and he was so excited by his favorite way he 's telling him that he would play me .
and he wanted to be part of the site of
this has been found .
so , he 's working on us now for two years , and we 're putting our own way to your way of freedom , because he knows if you want to change it , and if you 're going to change the right tools to the hand , you can
the bottom of these disorders are people like them .
people who come with us to school at the street , to get that to our own work with us to get our teachers with their power to come to their personal
these are our discoveries , which is based on our news , that they have students to make the environment , the logic of the plants .
and these are our instructions that our students are right on the stage to the next .
and also these people are doing very much about our program .
one example .
we 're doing a practice to make sure called this .
we then put in the middle of the room in the center of the room , our police system , our students are on the one hand ,
and i think then , then , i think
and every time someone in this question , he just immediately immediately immediately .
and what you see here is what we all have in common , in the future , or outside outside .
but also , where the differences are .
and an example of this , where the differences is , i think is a question
i 'm born in a love that was made social a social way , or i had a family that had been in
there are a lot of our students at the bottom line at the bottom , very few of our minds
a question i like to do is to make all of us that are based on that i want to make you .
i want you to let me stand up all one of them
maybe we can get a little light on the audience .
i can see you .
it 's all everybody .
amazing .
thank you .
i 'm going to ask you a question , and if you ask that question , it 'll take you back in a way to get you to .
that 's kind of like our line we 're going to go .
i have been doing that in my life , so i 've been able to have been stopped , but it 's not
if you ask that question , `` do you want to answer it .
this is the key to be the enemy 's body .
this is to say , perhaps , get smaller amounts of the way to
this is the real thing that 's not really the main player that we have .
okay .
and it also matters that maybe any of the more years could not always have more than more than
all right .
most of them are sitting .
we have some kind of map in space .
this is wonderful , i 'm happy .
thank you so much , you can all get up all up
so , in this question , if we 're going to take it on the level , our minds come very often
and many will be clear , how much good you might have ever had .
happiness , with the parents , happiness in the environment that they were living with , with their friends , but also for the fact that they may not be able to get there , if you had something at the edge of the power or the
what are the results of our work ?
so , 99 percent of our students find a lot of days after their own line .
so , it 's fast quick .
`` you 've made percent already all over the ]
a third of the base mountains in the past year .
and our power is completely at seven percent .
i 've told you , i 've told , the power of seven percent is a power in germany by 90 percent
i am not alive .
a huge amount of energy is a year in a year .
and it 's a beautiful environment , and this is a collection that is a collection of seven percent of a collection of it , is usually about the
when my father and i started in power , we 're actually completely being to be honest .
i had been played my amazing life at the time in a big company
but i have to tell you , i do n't have that kind of a life working in my life .
we are losing our clients to take responsibility .
so , responsibility , what 's happening in your life is to take responsibility for you what it is going to happen in your life
not too , not to breathe .
because that leads to a new piece of research , and it allows to trust it to the time it
and so , that 's very happy to me , and i 'm going to tell you about our heads of
i 've got you a little video of mine .
movie .
so , i was introduced to two years old , and eight months ago ,
i was so grateful against the power to three years , and 10 months ago .
i 've been a little bit of a
so , i 've been trying to get rid of two years of being dangerous
i was being amazed for care of power and power .
so , through my education , my life has been changed to be changed by my life
and what was important for me , that was the threat that was made of being done .
because , in my case , my mind was , my fake
i was n't quite grateful , i would say , i 'd say , yes
i 've played that back again .
i 've been looking at it again . i 've been looking back to
and you go to a very different map and the rise of the nest .
now , there 's more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and
with the wrong people , and that 's not the more .
well , the problem is that many of you have no capacity to have a common capacity when it
and this is the biggest problem , because then you 're going to see that you 're going to get back to
you do n't know anything else .
by this level of life , no matter what you 're going to do is to look at me in my own way to me about others , about the experience of the people , to the extent , to the society that has been completely completely done during the six weeks .
i 've been on my first woman for my first woman .
and for about six months , i was going to go back to you .
so that means we have a new relationship .
and because i 'm also interested in other things , and many other things have changed .
now , a lot of that i 've got
i am with my family back back to the most vulnerable time .
so , i 'm working in my position , i 'll say , i 'm
i 'm going to do a power for a power .
you really have to feel that it 's very , very many people who are really , like , for example , my favorite thing 's going to be around , and i think about it , and i do n't know , is based on the people
i am grateful that you 've never seen the idea that they do like this .
i am grateful that you have trouble with safety action at work , and i am extremely grateful that i had to be part of it .
and of course , in fact , there 's also all the people who were support that
i would say i 'd like to talk to many people at the time , and they always have always heard of me and have been a good thing
and that 's what i 'm doing for you .
and i thank you , i thank you .
come back to us .
each of you has something to have what we need .
whether they were talking our business business system , if they were to tell us as they are as a financial support to them in the face of a
whether they want our program to be a new place , completely free history .
let 's talk about that .
martin 's milk , and i 'm here today .
and you know , look at that conversation with them .
thank you .
i 've been doing it based on power waves in the wild system .
in a while i was something that was worth a little bit
there you are doing things like that .
it 's based on its care .
the power goes .
one in the kitchen cover is taking one
there are really many ways to be there to be able to deal with clean education
so , as you can get to model the
but anyway , i was also a light bulb
with my work , little with the power of it .
now , as i 'm really talking about here .
and not so real problems .
my problem was , and i could really look at the same as my life in 10 seconds , 30 years ago .
it was dreadful .
and that surgery actually found it .
to make it a little bit .
basically , i had a confession , completely open memory .
the way we have the same
i did n't know , did i know the more going to go
do i just like to make it sound
or what if i 'm going to try to write my way back
and look at what happens .
and then i 'll leave you .
that was the idea of thought .
i was free in that time .
as i said , i 'm
the power was also true for me to be the incredible object .
you spend the world 's energy , and you 're living around the world in very good buildings and services for a very ,
but also , also , very low countries .
countries where i think are more likely to see , and say , even at least long , or with a matter of time , people do n't have to do it ,
that 's actually about these images and the nest , but it 's also a
and that was for me for a while .
i was that what i did was that .
to face .
and i thought i 'd make a little bit of a power from myself to a country that i do n't really know right in .
i wanted to change that .
i wanted to make countries right .
to make sense of paper .
and to make my personal interest too .
how do you know how to do countries ?
by the way , by humans .
and when it 's in people , it 's going to
not in the hotel .
by the way , by the way , to the challenges and to the problems of
and by the way , by the way , by
at least , that 's the answer that i could ever put on this question .
and i wanted to do that .
i also wanted to do something in a classroom
i wanted to make a banjo .
something good do .
and that feeling of interest in me is actually more more vulnerable to me .
i was a lot of time in countries , but in fact , i was trying to do
by the time , there 's a tasmanian percent , not just using the mechanical atoms , but also , but also ,
with a $ average black rate , i have an water 's gdp of gdp to the
and certainly , one of the six poorest countries in the world .
a quarter of the population is living below the poverty .
almost a fifth of the population of people who are on
forty percent of adults can not read and write .
all these facts are connected with lots of personal stories and the ones that i found on the whole journey of my journey , and at the time i was ready , and open for change
i wanted to change something in a way that i
and the point was to come after my own favorite decision to come from
i graduated my job .
and i was looking at the aid of the
and i 'm going to open up just a little bit of the answer to the most answer i 've been
because they just had a sense .
it 's about a serious event of a design event at creating international international people
and not to do that , for a power to open up , you will not have less time to get in a local life ,
hello ?
is that still ?
my passion was really serious and good .
at least , i thought that was
and that answer was a complete threat .
i was really proud .
and , of course , you 're going to have to write a
and fortunately , never forget .
instead , i 've actually been able to make that very useful sense of what good design doing this
i used it as a mayor to help my own company .
it 's true .
heart works and dance power .
so , one company that basically did exactly what i was doing in the back .
so , the way to do is that the opportunity to do
the possibility of a country is called a country .
by talking to people , by the way , to be able to live
and not going to happen somewhere , but in a way , it 's
you can not afford by the way that you can see
so , working and power .
so , it means something like this to do good things .
you can do good things .
sound can play more little .
it 's not .
is power a social space of business .
we use that we use co2 as a tool for sustainable
so , what we use is that what we use is that
so it 's open , it 's heat ,
because the people who are constantly used to fly with us during their heads of the tissue
they pay for their journey , like a different kind of a staff .
but they 're just moved different .
they live on power .
and the irony is not too much to not or much or not a lot , but real power
social interaction .
and uncertainty .
and that 's what our workers have ever been to have , and they 've ever
we can do through our work for a professional investment in rich , which would have no chance on conventional education .
because just the infrastructure are getting solved .
so , to give you more sustainable projects .
we can go to have a sustainable study of work and
so we tend to give up another hundred percent .
they 're not on their own .
and that 's what 's happening for our current debate about meaning .
we started with our work right now in prisons .
so , i 've been talking about this on a distance ,
and now , after four years , i 've been told you , i 've been married and my husband , and i also have a team in a
so are we going to go to the way
or what if we think more bigger than that ?
if we keep the competition to go on ?
if we do n't , if we do n't , we 're doing social connection to do the social use and
and then the individual differences with that kind of life
or even a whole bunch of individual individual
so , then , basically , this is a new company , basically
one company that goes to companies .
but with others , the same philosophy of the same philosophy is
do we want that ?
it 's the next question .
what about wireless new companies ?
we 're certainly that we 're going
we love entrepreneurs and their creative companies .
because we 're getting a lot of
because we talk the same language .
because we dream of the same dreams .
because we understand the challenges .
and so we have made a sister on this year .
it 's true .
and with power , we collect creative businesses in their development and these things that we support through some amazing people .
and we 've got the people to get our own , entrepreneurs , or by creative companies , with
so , the personal social social and environmental content come up with completely open .
and it 's really taken to the level of life
there are also coming back to that in the world
a drone will be a standard of a kind of a sense of life ,
he 's looking at a very short time where you are in , where you 're open .
you might have a tv player right now .
so , you know , where you might be , perhaps a little bit is
and he shows a point where you 're right right .
and then you can get a power in your

and the force of things to change things that can change .
and you can change a lot .
in a short time , i have already

one example of this .
these are the primary inner life , the flu and power .

it 's been beautiful , it 's been on the years
and since years , nothing happened .
because they just had a market deal .
because they did n't know how they can improve the quality of the quality
because nobody told you what design might be in the moment .
we wanted to help these women .
and so , in that year , a life is started .
totally completely relationships .

they give a income .

we 've gone on here with life .
and we start with a single bit of these tissue .
a total percent of thousand power of our women 's population .
the pressure is not just one year a million year .
but also , it also helps us to make a much more bigger to do

we do n't want to just only only five women 's work , but we do n't
and not just in uganda , but also in the '50s and in other ways , we 're working on the oceans .
but this is , in this kind of fact , only a project from our own power
we 're working in all the middle areas .
in the area of life , we 're getting on the laws and
because the work is just just a very simple way to do that .
what happens to the children when they do it with the kids
right .
so , we 've been started to do this year in a year in 2001 , and in pakistan
everything is going down into our heads .
and the whole thing is more interesting than any single project is of being a project .
we have that kind of spread out of our own projects in the
the most kind of things are always going to be done in the same work
and i would like to just end up just directly to a journey .
and that 's what i want to leave you with .
`` you 're on , you 're in africa . you
in rural heart of cartoons .
you 're sitting on a rock .
and it 's just fun and it 's
you just got to get your clothes right now .
there was clouds .
it 's true .
milo 's seat .
the walls are more .
in this case it 's a really good duck
you 're out of the window .
and you see kids on their power completely come on .
their own foot down the sand on the sand .
you 're on your power .
and also , you can get a very thin layer of space
the children are laughing .
and call it to say the name is to
you 'll notice that they 're not only call to lose that anymore .
it 's true .
you do n't know how long it is .
but soon , you 'll get up .
and the power of it , on one hand , has been taken with the kids
at the end of the street , it 's a big

it 's also a nice time to talk to speak .
you 're listening to music .

you 're happier and happy .
you can go back to that eyes .
each of us can imagine that completely in a new event .
or at least a short time for the blood pressure again , again , again
and then you see what happens .
thank you .
before i start thinking , i would be interested in whether you 're going to get to the last evening you 're here , soon , somebody has already
i do n't show you , but i 'll just want to give someone a little bit right now .
here i do the one on the bottom .
two .
here , i 'm not sure , but at any point there , there 's a lot of the people 's top there , and there 's a lot of that , and
i also have a building , and i was working on the building at the east of town .
that 's the building .
with six other people , i 've been able to have been done the village village village in six months
and so what i 'm going to do is that tonight i 'll
and now , like , some of you might be told .
what is it ?
there 's no many people out there .
but i want to explain it briefly .
what do you think now , are you working on the
and you 're in a park , like , what ?
just a little bit of questions that are known to us , friends , colleagues , when you 've learned that i 'm part of a generation to start with , something that 's worth easier .
all the time we were in the series of power we had .
and here , they 've been building these graphs , completely , very , very common and fishing .
and to begin to explore the absence of these buildings around them
but i know that 's not my kind of a legacy .
and it was also not the oldest power of the poverty .
what we see here is a number that is totally coming out of that in space .
this is a public space that is only available , and that 's why for many people , you do n't have to live , but not in the public hand , and that is n't as being used with public systems .
we were a group of atoms living in the words of power , and they got a little bit of power and sustainable .
and we wanted to tell a different kind of life
we were a blank team , and i just got to get in this way for very , because it was a very common
from the most part of architecture , mental engineering -- politics -- and open on , are efficient , design , dreams , passion , are safe and out of
and of course , with different social cultural and personal devices also ,
and our results are focused on and out of
and we 've been able to put it into different , but also in different networks .
and creative , creative , special factors to be in the field that we 've done .
we actually chosen to sleep the buildings that we have .
but it was all about us to do the buildings with stories and ideas .
we 've got out and we 've got to tell
and from all of that memory , these memories , trying to get some possible outcomes for the favelas
and it was really important to the process that we 've ever seen .
we have a health self that we have used to be used to be on the time and
so , it was a cruel and error and a sudden , and it became a completely open ,
and we 've done that the experience that we 've done with you , right ? i 'm going
every city has a whole bunch of place
so , you know , a bubble gives a
in many cases , these were the ones that we see , and they were being sold in a kind of human capital
they 're the dead places under a city because they 're not often the most part of what we 're trying to do in a
so , for example , we have to have open up , we
so those , but also , in fact , the public areas of the city are being increasingly , this is
now , biologists that want to do all the way that you want to do in this place are often the
what has it done to me , so some questions here , some of them say , are there to say
i mean , a lot .
these places are not just a face of our city .
no .
they 're the social places of our city , in which our genome is all over .
so we 're actually using a lot of time here to do with our neighbors , if we 're going to meet ourselves to the
and you can get these together when we 're just able to sit in a very clear way , and we actually think that the space is also a lot of
and we 're just eating eating food .
and then they share , sometimes sometimes .
but what happens to be security is a feeling of community .
the more i 'm going to do with a public space that is the faster , and it 's kind of light in the same
and if i do n't get me down , then you 'll see that what you 're going to do is called the
we then were two challenges .
we can be able to consciousness and responsibility and control of their lives in the room , or in fact , in the
how can we be done in terms of a design
how can be a coffee player in ideas ?
and we drove that in mind , and then they 're going to be places and are going to be places and demand against the potential , and
imagine that you 're sitting sitting here , once , you get the newspaper on the wall and read your text text .
love to love and citizens , and we 're going to do to them that we want to give them three ways of reference for the oil of the oil , which
you could be able to choose with the idea of a moral rule
and the problem with most of the people is being done with the most
would you go ?
would someone be that event ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , it sounds great .
there 's an basic possibility that is driving .
you 're going to have to open up how to look like
and as i said , just as a great one in the first moment
i 'm trying to try to do a word .
and that is because i think they 're not really either either either , or whether or not the power or power ,
first , it 's a lot of time , a lot of
that means that they do n't have any opportunity to make their own feedback or make sense of the same option , but there 's actually a serious design , and they 're able to decide if they 're carbon or power into the city of
or , as a friend ago , what color lines is doing , for example , to know
second , i think , a great design key is really likely to go
think about three major pieces of data .
we have here that we want to show them , and they will be able to turn them
nuclear and more strong are often the consequences that i think i think i think i
i do n't want to tell you a decision about either or light , if i actually had to make sound of something rather than
but it 's also different .
although the rate of the plants have been given many more , we have a lot of a lot of
and we 've been doing some experiences that we 've got to do with , and i
i want to share it to other people 's data to see , but also , in fact , the city and the politics .
because the ones that are that they should be able to believe that kind of space that they should , and they actually
if that really is interested in a test of a test , like it is so many times and then , then we need to do a new position .
not the last thing i 'm doing , i 'm also in this one of you sitting here .
and that 's because i think of it in a very important way .
i 'm going to leave it to you that you 're all going to , and i want to give you with our example , to give you a chance .
and i do a lot of them in all of you because you 're the ones that can put a new amount of power to
so , what we have to do is to look at it and see the human consciousness , and to stop responsibility and control the space and to get
first of all , they 're paid to stick on
in addition to basically , more than , on the act of physics , human beings are
what we see here is a computer company that we asked to have .
what we see here are some of the gap and there are some of the things that
the goal has to be that all of these conversations are going to be linked , so that not the actual possible possible experience , or the actual impact of the people are
the citizens who are in place are experts , they 're experts for their brains , they know what they 're doing , which is to connect them with a place , where tradition is a place , and also what they need to do
the power of life , in fact , are able to get the same thing that 's going to be in the city
in the meantime or in a particular case , then more energy can be a way to take the things that are just built on the project , they 've been
so that all will come into a life that is all the information for all the information , and then it can be a real one
by perhaps able to be able to be able to be able to get a more more
a conversation on quantum field means that the god will be really serious about this seriously .
and that 's when somebody says , i want to make a space back to the solar genome .
now , of course , in general , it can be deeply connected to be , but the goal has to be , in virtually a conversation with all you , in the right solution , and perhaps the right solution , and maybe in
and as i said , it needs to be from the conversation of that
second , many are different .
our power is actually .
and it feels true when he can talk about a big amount of time , and then you can
another one can write a good time to your text , but not you can talk about massive a big
another one can sound or a piece of people .
or , do it matter ?
what i want to say to say it to be different to be solved at different levels of
we have this possibility right now for example to be able to be just the same time , which is happening .
in the background , little exhibition shows .
we have the possibility of being totally optimistic .
we have the possibility to paint .
we have the possibility to write .
except from the age of time
that was a real girl .
we had the ability to connect our ideas to play ideas .
also , the opportunity to be based on is totally to be to be always being always .
and that can happen in for example of a space that can happen to clean space .
the contrast and creativity are the results that are the only result that you have in
we have the whole process on facebook on facebook , and at one of them , it 's almost a bit of random eye , and at
our third point is being completely distributed
you may remember , remember , i told you that life is too late too late .
in my own experience , i 've already met three of them on
is this process that 's the process , but it 's only when it 's actually the work that the work is , and the purpose of the rule itself even
when through the conversation , and with that , i 'll be back to the point of a building , which is a most powerful thing that is going
it 's about the part of the day , of
and then , if not , if not we start by saying that , the most expensive time , it 's kind of like that , it 's the experience that you
what happens is , if the citizens are at their city , their city , they 're
is that in many projects , it 's already happening
i 'm here one example of mass of life , which is that it 's been , is probably here in a lot
in new york , it was a project , it 's a contradiction .
in fact , in danger , there are two weeks of dollars on five weeks that the drug can be able to make it happen
the time has been able to do this in a while , not different as the idea of their own .
and also , the power of this in new york , i have to say , because he has to be one of the most important to the city , it was no idea of politics or against business .
the opposite that is already found for the place already is .
in danger , so we 're back back in germany , and that citizens have already been able to actually have the equivalent of a place
the city was n't needed to be in the place .
the four weeks of life that we have are based on are totally totally totally open up with the risk of
today , the rate of city is coming .
and while the page becomes completely free , it 's amazing work , and the city are the main ones that have been the markets who started there and others
so , as a result , they own sensors , they 're
in copenhagen , a total gps lamp was being
all right now you want to say .
so , we 're going to do that now .
but i think it 's wrong to leave the city from responsibility .
why ?
one is that they have to be a look at the whole place or have to have .
while the feedback , the citizens , or the way , to help as the rule of one in the rule of the rule of one in the rule of the matter of one in the world , in some sense , the
and for some of the other part , when the city got the projects , the way to get to
a total percent can be only the only ones that we
but the goal was that we had found the goal of a representative african to this end of time , and it was about one year the results and the responsibility wanted
and what happens was that , of course , was actually put up
there are still other things .
so , unfortunately , we have a problem right now that we could not give responsibility .
but we 've already seen that if the city is actually more likely to have the work of the work when the nest maintenance workers have successful , that there 's a real deal to
in which form of view , it 's still open open .
to finish , i 'm convinced that many projects that are being designed with the meaning of complexity , or even their needs to be developed , to be able to be able to build a chance of the city , to
if you 're just talking about time and you 're in a conversation with the
in each one of city and cars .
in the other part of town , and you 're all going to sit here tonight .
if we were going to have our own and ever the quality of the world , we ca n't see the power of the citizens
that 's it .
yesterday , after the bat , we were in charge of life , and we 've got into this site .
we talked about taiwan .
so this idea of this idea , in this way , is to have a chance if you have n't science in this life , it 's just going to be
and we found that fascinating .
and we were very quickly , and we were very quickly realize that there are two things that we did n't want to experience .
one is the main christmas game .
the second thing that was also the most day , at the table , was the table
no .
no .
school , some of you may remember , even outside the outside .
i mean , i mean , i 'm like , right now , you know , the most year i have , you know , i think
my call your mind , and i want to just return on the front of the
and i do n't know how to do it , but in my mind , always the idea of it was that it was the one that was made to be the right seriously , that
no idea what is going to be in this place .
you know , it 's going to understand it , so my school actually was n't -- and then i started to get my last fan behind me , never to school .
and what 's going to say if i 'm doing this year , i 'm going to start to see some of the most beautiful days that i spent in high school , i 've
with big practice and completely transparent .
how did it get ?
how could this happen ?
and then we just started to start with that something happened to me .
i got children .
so my wife got the children .
and so , then , it was also clear that they were the top to have this kind of thing .
until that day , when she said , `` it is completely completely .
and today , they 're going to come
yes , christians .
and i went to the door and i sat in that kind of open and i 'm going to get it in this room and i 'd
and this was exactly what looked at it , in the same way .
and also , the test also , as a result , as a result of the school , and i 'm on me , and i 'm on the
and then , when i heard the teacher to say , you know , the kids are not learning for school , but for life , i 'm going to say , oh my god , i do n't get it in the sentence .
what is that what we 're looking at school , from this school , was really really looking at the life ?
so many of us have been learned to be right well .
where have you actually got to live in your life that 's all right now ?
and perhaps we know some of the things the capital of the guerrilla call .
what 's even more isolated than today ?
or , you know , that gap in a long time has a lot of knowledge in a lot of time , and so that i can be able to make a little bit
well , i 've lost it for the power , but otherwise ?
and what does a completely figure out of a level of a level of a point of a moment that someone
and if the main rule is , and if the good advanced properties has
no .
so , it 's possible for life , not for school , we 're learning .
if we were to spend that , roughly about the age of the earth 's century , you 'll see that there is ``
this is the time in germany , where in germany , it was totally turned out by the time
and where the bank system , we have this right now , has its family .
and if we then then then that happened to be , it was actually that people used to do people who had no access to know their time .
and there were these four or six years that they were trying to go to school , and to know that they were really the only way that they had , to get the knowledge and to get the most information of their time in their time .
today , a solar information can be more information in its pocket than the largest city in front of
and in the middle of the glacier century , that was the time of the
that means , you know , it 's a kind of change in the world , and suddenly , there were people who were able to put
but at the same time , people have got to get these machines to get their jobs
and we needed people to have the machines to have built those machines , and they put those
maybe you 're already able to see it
that 's true air , which we have now still have to have the control in this time .
and then there 's something that 's kind of
well , because it probably really really happened to that , that what i did in school , is to learn for the work that the most day was , who was the most part of his life .
let 's make a look directly in the future .
let 's just do this by the top century , where it is , and let 's look at that year
and the year 2000 , the first place was just beginning to come in front of that .
i was done with my trial , and i thought now that now is now now you are going to close the first company .
yes , after some people around me with the internet , then i think , i 'm doing that now .
and some companies are focused on us and they were increasingly bigger and more bigger , and we 're so beautiful and some of the companies that are in a normal case , then we can get in the normal case
you 've just seen two times in life .
and we then had been working on a few years ago .
so , we had a beautiful growth , and we had so long steps on how to make sure , literally completely completely completely completely
i do n't know if they have crazy extraordinary vision to do what these people do , but i did n't have an idea that it would be like that .
even when i was a fan of life , it was not talking about how the internet was
and the kids that we see today we are in the school , the job that will be in 10 , 15 , 20 or 30 years ?
the only thing we have in the mind is we do n't
and what do you know which are the facts that are going to be the need to pay in those future
and if you 're honest , the only answer you can do is , we have no idea .
and because we 're spending that in the future , what could i have to give to the final of the family
there is real chicken , i read .
well , you see , they have no idea .
how do we get out what to learn to life ?
what are the things we need to make children for life ?
and perhaps a look at what companies are looking at their own people in their own .
and that is basically the essence of school , yes ?
the dance students come from schools and university , and then they come into
and if you 're going to see that very serious classic , you know , it was first of the first thing , what is the connection .
so , you know , well , the question that they 're reading about is that , we 're looking at that , we 're going to get rid of
that 's going to be school and you ca n't afford to be able
but what if parents could afford to do , the things that are always really important , that they 're so important , and i am convinced that these are completely completely the most difficult position of the future .
and you can basically basically basically have three groups of reference in it
this is one , businesses wants to be treated , so that they 're alive , so simplicity is one .
then almost all of the companies have to think about stress .
and then , then , they want to have these companies who are totally
so we think of have a mental charge , and we
let 's start with the mechanics .
that 's pretty fast .
if we look at how economies works , how fast , how fast all changes .
right ? the wind is going to be the internet of the internet from this point on the head
and then i have to invite people to be able to change this change .
there 's a staff for me who are creative .
there 's a staff for me who are totally violent .
this is pretty the opposite of what the house was in the office , the house of the empire , was given by the top
the second thing about that is that it 's pretty clear to this
there is responsibility .
there 's people , for people , to take responsibility .
first time , and your own life , for example .
but also , for the big part .
now , if that 's the company , or as a society , we have people for the responsibility to take them up for
and the third thing that is largely that 's going to happen is that almost all will
and if we remember , we know about the five field , then there was this beautiful statement there .
now , in argentina , life has been fixed and has a team .
it was n't dead competition that has won the world 's world .
and they could do that in a way .
and as a kid , this big company of our time , steve jobs , yes , power .
it was n't the american invented that did n't invented any of the power , who did n't have any sense of what had invented it .
and the team that had done this possible , because only as a team could actually put what they were doing .
so , in school , that these three things could happen , that 's what we might do for a school school , where we 're learning
but there 's also a total fourth now , and it 's almost important to me .
and that 's learning itself .
if the only thing we can say about the future of security is , you 're optimistic , is the ability to learn and to learn new , and to learn the way that we 're going to have access to the rest of the world that we 're in our lives and our kids
and then , this is a great school that has to take out to
but where did i have ?
i was sitting in this puzzle environment and the kids who know that this is not exactly what 's known in the most term of it , for whom you have to pay .
so , the fbi thought about the state , it was still not from everybody .
until that moment , where 's been told , there is a lot of invisible that will all be
yes , i was sitting there , and what i 'm saying is that at the very part of my children , these are all the most of the
less but it was less fun for me to be asked when the kind of bird is about the subject of the time and learning the entire body
and even less fun is doing it , if the child is getting , because in school , you know , because
and finally , i did this life , or it was a member of that activity at the school .
and it was n't a real life that was , it was a little bit so much like a power so that the last hour and in fact , we were also the only parents that were
and i 'm going to make you now and also you know the details after the moment of this moment , we need to have our child a child that 's not
but interestingly , it 's two years where we 've been seeing there , it 's not working on
what do we do ?
and we actually had the question to ask , and we actually have the question
and are we the only ones that we do ?
now , i 've been talking to the last two years since i 've been talking to the subject with a lot of people , and i did n't know , i 'm afraid , you 're not alone .
there are a lot of that , there are a lot of the things that it was , and that was two years ago , and that was just a number of businesses , and that was a real thing i was doing , was actually going to have a new company , and we 've talked about the way that came out there
and what do i say , he 's almost the same story about me at one of his kids , he 's almost the same thing as we , and we had been lucky that we could get our kids out of school ?
in berlin , there is a clear clear of the sound on different schools , and we could even take into
but can everyone be there ?
and somehow , it was a little bit too little , just our kids to get in trouble and to let the database there and to do , to how
and after we 're now , after these first people who had been there , after we did n't change that , we were all right , we know , well , well , we 're the first ones to
just how to be a nuclear thing ?
the good thing is that we have been wrong .
we are not alone .
but we 've been found out very quickly to find these examples of amazing people that we would like to do what we like to do to , which is to make a
it 's not that only the kids and their parents have been under the status of what 's happening there .
if we look at the teachers , we have 30 percent of teachers have lost .
if we look at how the number of power in the last 10 years has changed , that has become a lot of time .
can it be all your parents ?
that all children are saying are , and that those teachers were their teacher ?
or , it 's going to be that we have a school system that just does n't take any more , like this level of fact , in the way that this collection was on a level
and we found a lot of people who were doing it , and we even found people who do n't have kids .
and they understood that they need to take responsibility for the future that they need to spend for the future , by thinking for the future , by taking responsibility for what we are kids and the kids who are now going to school , to the path .
and we 've been able to put the second thing about to see if we 've got some of the examples of great statistics that are there , there 's some of the great factors that are going to change in school , and there are real schools , there 's real , and there are really awful about
and there 's even one that 's one or the other kind of cool , and then you can also get the first step
and how would we help as a power ?
we did n't have a sense of that , that there was all about help .
but we can do one thing , we can go into those schools , and we can do in those schools who are in school , so the parents , the teachers and the students , are together , and we can move all the amount of things in the two days
so there 's people , and you 're going to do that in the past so much more work and help you learn to two days , what it means to
so , here are some basic challenge to solve them all together .
and after two as a few times , they 've been able to develop a new mechanism and create the bus , that we could actually be in new feet as we could to be
