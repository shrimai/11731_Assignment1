as steve as an adult , i grew up in los angeles , a day by the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , a newspaper , a newspaper , a pen , a phone person , who was on a remote group , who was only two
many of you will know the story , because from the very famous paper conference later , later , when i was a book , a writer ago , with robert 's photographer , who was an expert , was an expert , a physicist , who was an expert , a physicist , who was
and what i did was close in the middle of years was a writer , and 30 years later , when he was a police student at the streets
i 'm telling you all to you , and i 'm a writer , and i 'm going to show you the film of what you 're not only in the wonderful , but you know , the music of the other men , but also how the music 's music was able to help this connection , and as you finally
i met `` charlie '' at the years of 2008 , two years ago , in the van empire journal square
he just had a report of a wonderful sentence and studied in a row of the summer to imagine myself .
he was talking in a very unusual , very little bit of the latest design and a writer , and the way the organization would never be able to create the `` world world , '' and this is all about the most ted age of the first
we came to the subject of music , and a few days later , i got a email , and i was a email in the cold , that the way that i
i have to say , `` i have to say , '' a medical treatment is to say , a medical treatment , because he had already been with a community with a bicycle and a journalist and a
now , as a result , it 's particularly more powerful for these ancient developed design , and it 's sometimes as bad , and it 's been going to go on for every day , in the streets of the morning , and that
and in just the way that a catastrophe was focused on , when we started to the nearest restaurant school center at the university of the soviet empire of the soviet union , he had lost this memory in
he talked about invisible and his name , and to how he wanted to wear a game of her sleep
i was afraid , not art , but i was afraid that i could be able to lose that he could be able to put his own business community and that i could be able to prevent the relationship of the collective services when i started thinking about
so i started playing .
i was wearing the first sentence of a visual accident .
and while i was playing , i found that in an adult , '' in a way , it was a kind
it was as if he was under the nature of a hot cell phone , a chemical reaction , that he seemed to my game .
and , you know , `` tesla 's marriage , '' against the way , `` i
and like a miracle took his energy and started to play and asked some samples from a little bit of the word , and asked me to play to the end : `` oops , mama , mama .
and we then started to talk to music about music , started by the side of the steel , texas , the founder , and all the other ages of surgery to go to an
and i realized , he was n't just a brilliant message about music , but he had a very good personal relationship with her .
he talked to her talk with a passion and an understanding that i 'm going to know about my colleagues in the lung school of los angeles .
by music , he talked to music , and about music , was from this journalist , a guy who was still in the streets of los angeles , a computer man , a mathematician , a mathematician , a minister , a minister
music is medicine . music is what we all music
for the sake of power music , music is
because the music allows him to give their thoughts and they were able to have some of the principles and creativity in something that
and so he 's actually playing his songs .
i understood that , right , that 's the nature of art .
and so in fact that , we do n't have music , we have a little bit of a deep deep in the inside , our emotions , with our cognitive protein , of our creativity , of the way in our
and the reality of the nervous is all of us , and we move away and we can get
what sheikh beetles were doing was made up the music back into a community of friends .
the economist force of music led him back to a family of engineers that describes him that his secret would come and was a research for it .
and i 'm going to go back to you again , whether in the state of mexico , an economist in the van desert journal a lot of times , because he reminds me why i
thanks a lot .
bruno giussani : thanks very much . thank you .
robert magic .
robert anderson : i want to play a little bit , i have the blood to open in
i hope you 'll wonder me .
i have a lot of fish in my life .
i only had two loved letters .
this first one , that was more than an crazy test .
it was a beautiful fish , a little fish , a good road , a book in the calendar .
what a fish .
and yet even better , he was born in the journal world 's largest largest largest biggest biggest
so you could feel feeling of it .
i had a picture of a few months .
one day , the head of the company , and asked if i could be able to write a piece of the rest of the car
of course , i said .
here was a company that was trying to solve what this extraordinary problem was going to have to be done for our weapon , how do we keep a fish
in the last 50 years , we 've been introduced the oceans for the way we 've made forests
it 's hard to recover the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish who we love to love , the ones , the ones , the ones , the ones , the ones , the ones
it 's almost nothing left .
so , maybe , bad bush , i 'm going to be a part of our future
a lot of the things that are around , a lot of the things that are going to be in the world , and they would have the environment in
he has a ph.d. time from 15 to one .
that means , 15 pounds of magnitude are needed to get a dead bomb .
not very sustainable .
it does n't seem very well .
so here was a company called the end of a company trying to make it right .
i wanted to paint them .
and on day the event , i called the head of the public public industry for the company
let 's call him a fake .
`` yes , '' i said , `` only to have the facts to be true , you have a famous thing , so far out there on the ocean , you ca n't get rid of it
`` that 's true , '' he said , `` we 're so far outside that the oil 's going to be a fish 's point of our fish .
and then it 's using , `` we 're basically a small world .
this is the aerial gallery of the sentence to a second , he
`` the best in the business . ''
and i had an amazing journalist .
`` queerer one of what do you think ? ''
sustainable drugs call he said , `` he said .
`` great , '' i said . i said it .
and at this night i was in bed and thought , what happened to the hell was a political protein ?
so i said to the next day , and a little bit of the event , kind
i said , `` yeah , what are the natural feedback ? ''
he said he did n't . he 'll go .
well , i 'm going to lose a few people in the company , and i would have to give a sanitary note , until i finally started to get the
let 's also find him ,
`` you know , '' what for example are powerful proteins ? ''
now , he talked to some tone and some kind of letters , and then he said , ``
i said , `` solomon ? ''
he said , `` yes , mama , skin , baby , blah , blah and food system . ''
i said , `` how much percent is worth , chicken , ''
so , from the act of the literature , maybe
`` well , that 's about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , `` yeah , what is really sustainable to spend chicken in your fish ? ''
there was a long night in the air room , and he said , `` there 's just too much glass on the world . ''
i was practicing myself in this fish .
no , not because i 'm an old journalist and a journalist .
that 's actually the case .
no , i have actually been able to put a ph.d. out of that fish , because i was a god at god who has the fish on this stage
this second fish , that 's a different kind of computer game , is
it 's the most romantic way of looking at it that the better you can do with your own fish , you know , you know , you know ,
i first started in a restaurant in a restaurant .
a recent poet had long for a long time in a row .
it 's got us in front of us
he came to the table , almost as a light white color .
the farmer had an accident .
keep twice .
he was still getting sick , he was getting
who can make a fish , if he was born , is n't it ?
i ca n't , but this guy can .
let 's call him free , actually , he 's lying .
and no , he does n't have a shoe , he does n't have a car . at least in the way that she and i understand .
he 's a ring at harvard de janeiro .
this is a gallery in the 1980s factory corner at the time
it 's near the dawn of the river .
until the surgery , the farm was in the hands of the season .
they 're wiping out on what 's been around them .
they did this by the country by which they had to be
they built this complicated range of cotton satellites , and she sells water out of the land , and it goes into the river
well , you could n't do that , not sustainable .
and it was an disaster one , a disaster
it took about 90 percent of the birds to the place that are many birds to the place .
and so , in fact , an electric company has bought a car company .
what do they do ?
they 've got the river of the water .
they literally put the press .
instead of the water , it used the seeds to cut the water back to the water
they ate the viability lanes .
they created an artificial professional ship -- they had an apple designer , a minister , a dolphin -- and they got hair and his company got the capital bank
the farm is incredible .
i mean , they 've never seen this before , ever .
they 're moving out on the surface floor , which is a million miles away , and everything you can see are : 2,000 meters and those are burning , and
i was actually not long at a long time ago .
he 's an extraordinary guy , three parts of charles letters and a piece of a light ball .
okay ? so we were , and we were doing through the production and we were doing for a job and a journalist , and i was doing a little bit of time a
here it is , it 's using a tiny device
now he 's talking to the minister of the guerrilla
and here , here , it looks a pattern of play , which led to the enemy .
it turns out that the rate of the biggest part of his career lived in the journal national national national national national
i asked him how he was the plane 's day .
he said , `` fish ? i do n't know anything about fish .
i 'm an expert for relationship . ''
and then he goes , and it goes into a more talking to the visual birds and the name , and
and understand me , i do n't hear , that was really fascinating , you know , the native community , so it 's in the same
it 's great , but i was love .
and my head was slightly sick of this , very low fish that i had in the back of the
so i did it . i said , `` solomon , how come out that your fish is so good ? ''
he showed up on the grass .
`` i know , boy , the invisible ones , the most vulnerable , the relationships , the relationships , that
but what are food about their fish ?
how is the objective warning ? ''
now , he goes to tell me that it is such a powerful system that the fish , the one that would eat , they would eat the most expensive .
the richest community , the most vulnerable , the most vulnerable , that is what the fish hold .
the system is so heavy , it 's really inevitable .
there is no food .
the one of a farm is being that the animals does n't want to
later , i was walking on this scene with the car food , and i asked him , i said , `` for a place to be here , '' like any of the car i 've been in , `` how do you
and that 's when a game would wanted to have a resistance .
and we flew around the corner and we took us up the most amazing picture , thousands and thousands of times , which is literally the same as the eye as the
`` that 's success , '' he said .
`` look at your village boxes , you can see a
they failed . ''
nt ? i was completely amazed .
i said , `` solomon , do n't you just get your fish your fish
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we lose 20 percent of our fish and not cut to the birds .
now , last year , on this level , more birds , more than 80 different species .
it 's the largest one , one of the most important private success in europe .
i said , `` solomon , is a good thing to the last one , you want to have a surgery ? ''
he plays his head , no .
he said , `` we build a hypothesis , not not serious .
this is a three-dimensional network .
the most effective workers eat the nest threshold
the mobile phone workers eat the glacier .
so the way the head of the head is the better thing .
okay , let 's take it to work . a farm that does n't have any harm and a farm to go to health in their own heart care at the heart
a german accident , but also a coffee accident .
oh , and the idea that this level of terrorists does n't even have to be
they 're running in a city of an city 's kilometer where the solar system is better for the speed
every morning they fly down 60 miles to the farm .
and every night they fly back to 60 miles .
they 're doing that because they can follow the top white lines of the ground rouge .
seriously .
i had to show a kind of journey of the penguins , and i looked at a lot
i said , `` solomon , do you go to the south miles and fly back to the night ? ''
do you have that to the kids ? ''
he looked at me as if i was doing a song about a hundred year-old party .
he said , `` no . you do this , because the food is better . ''
i do n't have the skin of my grandmother 's skin -- the cat was , and i do n't like any wheels . i do n't like them . i do n't know
it 's that broken , abstract noise .
i 'll never give you the shoes .
and yet , when i put it in this restaurant in berkeley , it did n't even try to catch a crash .
she loved the sound and the place as if you take a radio flow from the ocean .
i mentioned the peace at the time of the time ,
he said , `` the skin is kind of like a gold system
it 's the last killer of the human script before something in the body .
it turns out to be a social economy over evolution .
and then he turned to it : `` but our water has no disaster . ''
okay . one farm , the fish did n't touch it , a farm that 's based on the success of their own income .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that does n't have any copyright , he was going to give it enormous , because the water that 's going to come through this farm from the river
it 's a river that allows all of the things that are happening to be in the natural world , to actually lead them to create chemical electric , controlled of surgery .
and if it 's in the system of the system , and this is the water 's the water , as it 's a little
the system is so heavy , it 's called the water .
so not just a farm to not not not not afford their animals , not just a farm to look at the health of your own pressure , but a farm that 's literally a disaster , and not just for those fish , but for you and me .
because if the water hits , it did it in the ocean .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i 'm going to take it , and i should do it also , because these things , like , are always in the same
you might say they 're an instrument for the future to be good for whether we speak of the coffee or the age of a
now what we need to do is an incredibly radical concept of agriculture , from one in food , in food , in fact we
but for many people , that 's a little bit object .
we 're not a farmer , we 're clapping . we are biased .
we love to do this . we love small baby ; we 're eating our food . we eat our food
and if you say that the things that the future of good food does n't think of it somewhere and says , `` hey people , i love x 's love , but how are you going to feed the world ?
how will you feed the world ? ''
marcus : can i be honest ?
i do n't like this question .
no , not because we 've already enough enough to feed the world more than just .
one billion people will be in charge of each
a billion -- that 's more than ever before -- because of the earliest people in the world -- not the queen .
now , i do n't know this question because it has the power of our birth for the last 50 years .
so , according to the earth 's individual , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you 've got the same time and you asked the time , `` if we spend more people ,
that was the monkey chord . it was the mall . it was the u.s. government 's market care of
we should call them what she is , a computer school in a coma , a single one , that fast the same capital that is exactly this community .
this is not a shoe store , and it 's not agriculture .
our grandchildren 's today is under the same time that , but it 's not about illegal resources
not by the latest brothers and an artist , but through the 20th country not by no water but by clean water , not by the water , not by the north , and not by the north , and not by the north ,
they want to feed the world ?
so let 's start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create the challenges that any community will produce themselves ?
to do that , you do n't look at the coffee for the word .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , private and women have a privilege , and it never has a really good thing .
let 's take a look at this social model .
this is the one that we 're going to take two billion years of
look at number of , farmers like chinese .
so , companies who are not going to be a world of who are not a world , businesses , who are going to be on the basis of a lot of the money , who are getting worse ,
because they are the ones who are experts for leaders .
and if i really am honest , it 's a better one than i 'll be .
you know , it 's right , because if the future is good food , you will be free .
thank you .
if i want to introduce a point today , the area of the data that we 're going to eat is bigger than the sum of your parts and rather than to think about how we can use information to how we can make a way of
so what we 're seeing here is a typical level after age as a age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it 's called the opera and what i can do with the problem is that i can be able to paint a certain kind of personal ,
and immediately , i see a different pattern that is going to take you
and that , because in the video section , people are the people who are looking at it and they 're over
we can take one step further , and we can see the data and we can see the data and see the data and the fact that the normal ones are
now if we go to continue and look for old , we can see 40 years or we can see that , even 40 years or we 're going to see that the same that
and who gets an objective view that this is actually particularly in men .
so what you see is that the result of information and data in this kind of different way is that it 's very much at
and if we can do this for a health , why not too much for the content
what we 're here now is the kids are going to have a single `` an `` an '' '' that ever
it 's all over there . it 's all online .
you can test it with my talk in the sun .
with the time , you can put it into a decade
you can put in a long year .
you can go directly to a certain type of letters .
now if i look at the bottom here , i see the silk atoms that come in that video games and the
i 'm a graphic historian , so i 'm going to go through to see all the slides in which i 'm talking about santa at
now , if i wanted to have a sanitary pad , i can say , `` ok , what if i were going to go around me with this topic ?
so i go back and i 'll take the perspective .
now i see `` a storyteller 's license
and so you get a sense of that , that if you go to this kind of information , you get a lot of information , you get a lot of information , you get a lot
you make something that 's a little bit of fact .
it 's something between , and we think it 's changing the way that information can be used .
so i want to make this idea a little bit further about what a little bit crazy is .
what we have done here is we have the same single , and it 's actually going to go up with a little
the head is a short decision and a symbol of the area that you see .
i just just just get the top half of the most popular season
but even in those games , we can do a lot of things .
immediately we get a sense of the elements that are on wikipedia .
i 'm going to choose to the theme of this issue
now , after i 've won adam , i 've known the privilege that most of the most of the most of the most of the time is to be honest ,
this really matters , because this is a sense of the fact that does n't put in a single plane .
it 's just to see if you step up with one step and look at it all
based on a certain kind of `` i 'm going to go back to the theme of the museum of the year , and all the way in between
now if i know all these people , i know the majority of these are being accepted , some of the science that are being made of science , some , even less , come out of the economy . and one comes from the coffee
and interestingly , it 's actually a ted , a ted company
so we can now face and give a look at the ted level and the french music
you see , we 're driving the web the first time it really is a web , not just of the side , but much more of it .
and so i want to show you what a little surprise might be .
i 'm just going to show you the new york times .
now , the way -- i do n't want to call it the best thing : it 's not an image , but you can look at it -- and we 're going to put this job to every single
so i can go back and look at a particular note of cool , and i can
now that 's important to be , because you just see , you just see that there are a way of green holes in this kind of way that can look at all
so i can actually live in my lab room in a particular period .
here 's the end of the whole piece i 've ever been on there .
and i can all , i can just get out , i 've been looking at a living
and , if i take a step back and look for everything , i can actually be able to think new of a living , maybe , like , i 'm looking for a journalist , here at the moment of life , or here
and from here , i can come up into the page and it again again .
it 's a metaphor that will be used , and every time it does n't power the size of the universe as the sum of the species
right now in the world , we think that data is a computer one .
we 're talking about the dawn of the sentence .
we 're talking to `` not talk to information . ''
what if we could add this situation to go and the internet on its head so that we can always be able to go from a to a different way , to go to a lot of things , and how patterns that can be left with a lot of things ?
if we can do this , this game would have been able to get a new source of information , maybe
and , instead of just just to move into information , we can know it that you can .
and if we know know , we can even take it back to it .
and so i 'm listening about , thanks a lot
i grew up with a tremendous cultural science fiction .
in my school i was working with the bus at school every day a hour ago .
and my head always kept up to a book , a minister that my thought of being a different world , and i would say it was a lot of time my favorite kind of
these guys also found that i 'm always when i was n't in school with the forests in school , and i was able to put a lot of them in school , and i was a little bit of a group of a team called a team and a
i was totally amazed , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and the boundaries of the species .
and my love to science fiction , in my environment , was being able to get me up in the late '60s , we started to the moon and the deep sea
and what we 've been doing here is that there was a very amazing place that was happening with his amazing film that we can see and places and a whole world of designers
that 's probably probably good at this ancient device .
and i was artists .
i could pull around . i could paint .
and there 's no video games , and there 's actually a little bit of the way that i 've been talking about , the whole thing in the landscape ,
we had to figure it out , if we were to college children who were our first book , we were able to put the side of the control and we put
my response to this was the drawing and the combination of the buildings , in the wild world , in the wild world ,
in the meantime , i was always working by the teachers i was working on the board light ,
the creativity must be somehow out there .
and something interesting happened to me that something interesting , which i remember at santa arabia , was the idea that we really thought of an economic world here at our planet
i 'm sure i 'm never going to have a full world with a camera system . that 's pretty rare
but here was a world that i actually actually put on on the ground , on the planet , and it was kind of amazing and most kind of amazing , as well as all of that i had always been able to read
so i decided to become an president , i decided to become a lie .
the only problem was that i lived in a small village in canada , a few miles from the ocean ocean .
i was not able to catch this one on this
i was reading my father until he finally finally had a crash job in the morning , new york , a lot of the border , where we lived in the other side of
i made my career in a row of the arctic downtown in the middle of the middle of the winter
the ocean , a real ocean , i just had two years later , when we moved to california .
since then , in the 40 years , the moment of today , i have spent over three sides of water in a row of about a million hours in
and i learned to have the world of the deep ocean , even in the arctic ocean , that rich of life is very , as we really can really know .
the main spirit of nature do n't seem to have a lot of power in terms of our own , conventional
until for example , i 'm going to be a little bit of a lot of time that i see
and my love to the ocean , to the same kind of same way as the same way
when i was a kid , i was an job journalist . it was an accident .
this seemed the best way to draw my inner arm , to tell stories with my need to create images of my need .
as a child , i always joined the books and the
so , as far as they were looking at pictures and stories , that was what we
of course , the stories i was hoping to be about was `` `` business , '' `` `` gold , '' and `` german . ''
in `` jeopardy '' i could take my faith for the anger and the online , with the coffee .
so , moving up , and i have my two
something interesting happened to me in the world : to solve a brilliant problem in this film , and that had to create a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of noise -- that we were able to
what happens was the first hadron collider ever ever ever seen in a film .
the film gave no money to a , in fact he just said his master , but i noticed something like this : that the audience were around all the world as a result of the magic 's people who did it
according to arthur , the law law is the law of the law of the law of the world
so they saw something like this .
and i found it incredibly interesting .
and i thought , `` wow , that must be in the 1970s . ''
so we went to `` basically , '' ] , i 'm going to go and see a lot
together with a sudden , we created the guy from the blue valley -- the success of all , to the one of the effect , like
and it worked . and again , we had a little crazy system , and the effect of the audience , and in fact , we have a little more money in the film
and from these two experiences , a whole new world was a very new world , a new world of creativity for a lot
so i started a company with my good friend , a friend of my good friend , who was at the time of the best day and a journalist , and she was called
the idea of this company was to see the stage of the led to begin with touch the time with your brain , and with the same time
we then did that , and we put a sort of time a little bit of
but the 1990s in the 1990s , we realized that we were in the workforce and we talked to -- we had a really , we started to get this into
i had written this piece , `` this piece , '' which was the flying flying in all of the brain effects and passionate effects of the whole new moments of brain , with most of the most popular characters that were made by a writing , and the marketing would be able to be all the
but the princess workers were getting out quite back . and the people in my company told me that we do n't have one to be able to do this .
so i started to conclude and made this other movie about the big house that was going on .
the crash i was as `` i 'm going to send this one day in a ship , '' it was an old designer form , a genius film
but what i really wanted to do was really just wanted to get the
that 's why i did the film .
that 's the truth . the final thing that did n't do .
i did believe that , in fact , i have a chance to say , `` we 're going to the store . we 're
we 're going to show it in the journal of the movie
that 's pretty important . it 's a good future for happiness . ''
and i stopped them , a more brand business .
sounds crazy , but this goes back to this , again , that the person can create a reality .
and we found in a reality , in fact , six months later , a reality where i was in a local artist , and i was a little bit of a local journalist , and i 'm looking at
that was not a movie , not a painter , that was real .
so , that really blew me really .
and the amount of discovery it was huge , and we had to build cameras and the nurses and
and i was looking at how much up this , an ancient device .
well , they were also in love and a really thought to start .
you 're going to go up into these labs , and you 're going to see them in this dark , dry environment , where no hope is on online , if you do
and i thought , `` wow , that 's just as if i 'm in a wheelchair .
that 's really true . ''
i was really obsessed with the rise of the deep ocean
but in the same way that , with curiosity and science , it was all about it . it was like , it was laughing . it was magic .
and it was an experience that was not going to be a high school .
because , you know , i could imagine a bit like a bit for the thing that we could make a visual effect , but i could n't , i could n't , what i would do , i could
in some of the following computer , i 've seen a lot of time in a lot of an airplane , and sometimes things that i never seen before , sometimes things that had never seen before , but never had before , and for the science of the world , when we saw it ,
so that 's really what i really really like to do , and i
and so i ended up with a little bit of a little
after the success of the web , i told myself , `` okay , i want to put my job as a nuclear engineer in hollywood in a ice store , and i would put
and then we started to put it to the market store , and we put it with a toy ,
we went back to the edge of the internet .
we took little robots that we built , which was a fantastic accident .
our intent was to take a witness and look at the inside of the ship , which never had before .
nobody had ever had the middle of the financial system ; they did n't have a sense of it . so we developed the technology
so , you know , i 'm sitting on the edge of the web market , in a coffee , and see that , in a toy 's seat , and i see that the viewer who knows this slide in here ,
and i fly a little tour through the edge of the ship .
i 'm going to put it to the point of it , but my consciousness is within
it felt like i was growing up in the journal of the most beautiful .
this was the most powerful form of a factory that i ever did , because before i was in a corner , i always knew what exactly the same in the heart of the car , i was talking to the crash i was talking to
the one on the top was a very simple computer type of the ship
so that was a really weird experience .
and she made me this argument that you use such a passionate program , and it would be like your own consciousness in the car , in this other form of existence .
it was really quite popular .
and maybe a little bit of a way of what might happen in a few decades if you have a chance to explore or to do something about what 's going on in all kinds of other things that i can think of as a
after these , we started to the conclusion that we were able to learn to learn , for example , that we really had to learn about what this kind of thing we saw in that incredible little bit of animals . that 's
they live with the ones that they live .
they 're not in a natural system of system as we do it .
and this is how you see animals that are just going to be able to survive , that they can survive in
at the same time , i was also really interested in for a really bit of a childhood , which was the
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in the room and to be sitting with the nasa and the real former plan . they 're going to mexico , somewhere that mission the most of the most exciting , and then to
that was fascinating .
but at the end of the end , it was the way i was doing was just a lot ago
i took them to the world , and i had to tell them to the world , `` i 've been able to help them the world down there , `` i 'm going to get them to the world . '' so i took them to the local arms , so they
we were actually met by , but we 're actually going to say science , in particular
and so the circle of my life as a kind of time as a kind of time , as a child , and the
in the course of that kindergarten , i learned a lot of
i have a lot of science thinking , but i think now , you know , a man must have to have a leader , a leader would be like a lawyer or
but i did n't really know a lot of the future before i miss this crazy
because at some point i had to say , `` what do i do here ?
why do i do this ? what come out of it ? ''
this presentation , i do n't get to give you a
we 're just playing the energy cost of the energy , and from the end
all right , i think , `` the web , '' and `` the `` vagina '' and i 'd put a piece of the ice ice ice back
i 've all been in the same movies , this kind of thing , for a very small
no hiking , no copyright , no money . what do you do ?
you 're doing the task to pay for the challenge -- and the ocean is the most basic environment that it is . you do it for the most exciting , and because of the weird connection that happens when a small group of people
because we have done all this with only 10 to 12 people that have been designed for years , sometimes we had two to three months on sea .
and in this community , you can see that the most important thing in the world is that you 're listening to each other , because you have a problem that 's not like to be able
if you go to land and say , `` we had to do it , the center , the crash , and that 's what the human genome is , if you do n't get the other you , you can not do this . that 's like
there 's a link coming in there , a drug in
so , when i started to put my next film `` the bird '' and i tried to use the same thing that you could take your team and you were actually in a state of the
it was really changing the dynamic .
so , i went back with a little team of a small team , and we were to `` the chief '' with a new technology that it was n't yet before
it 's exciting .
a huge challenge .
and we were faced for a while of four years to a real family .
it changed my way of making movies , completely at all .
there were people who believed , we would have really , really good in terms of concepts and the planet 's planet .
for me , it was more to do a more weird way of doing my job , the actual process , which changed on the sun .
so what can we do from all this ?
so what are the lessons we learned ?
i believe in first terms , `` i believe , '' curiosity
it 's the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
and the sum of your life is more important than any of the world 's
to me , young inventions , who say , `` do you give me a word how i could do something . ''
and i say , `` do n't give you any other .
and that 's what you 've got to do with you . it does n't stop you , do n't you give yourself against yourself , but you can
and the nasa actually got a dilemma , `` no alternative is no resistance . ''
but in the art and the process , it needs to be an alternative , because there is an amazing device .
not a big framework , the innovation , was ever , has no no one .
you have to be ready to give them risks .
this is the idea that i 'd like to give you the way i want to give you about the way . i 'm sure i 'm sure it 's an
today i am talking to you about a solar and climate change
and that would be surprised anything because my favorite job in the modern care of getting more and more and community in the future of the things that we have to do and to create the poorest two billion billion dollars a better
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , in fact , more than more than for any other on the planet .
and to say that their job will n't be to grow from many years , we would be too much or too much more . things that will be the way that you ca n't have hurt your way of
it leads to be too , it leads to the current system . it leads to the
so , going to be nice for you to become a climate
and also the success of the self is very important for
in fact , if you could just reduce a thing to the price , to the crash be energy to a higher energy .
now , the irony is always the time you 've been doing
in fact , the density is on to square
the economist are going to open the industrial revolution and even in the 20th century , a more successful in the heart business . and so we have a lot of research , and we 've got to make some complex
so we 're in a wonderful situation of electricity in the rich world .
but if we turn the price -- let 's go to the price store -- let 's go to a new wave , and this wave line of carbon dioxide .
co2 is the planet in co2 -- and the key is pretty clear to co2 is
they 're forced to grow the carbon carbon system , which is the main honor of the success and this architects has some very profound effects . the effects of the ocean and the worse , the memory of the natural life , the natural life can not be able
now , the same relationship between a childhood and the air opera and where the other consequences are , there 's some of the satellites , but not very many .
and there 's no safe things about how bad those lines are . but they 're going to be extremely bad .
i asked the times times long , who really got to come down and get it down to zero
do n't we have the $ half or a genome ?
and the answer is , we 're going to get zero up , will increase the temperature .
that 's why it 's a huge challenge .
it 's very different to say , we have a $ blank foot , and you have to have a $ foot under a $ , you know , you can get it out of it
this one has to come up at the bottom of zero .
well , we 're going to put up a lot of coffee , about a billion billion tons
every company took 20 tons , people from poor countries , less than one .
in average , it 's about five tons of every on the planet .
and somehow we have to have change that this is going to get down to
it 's actually been limited to this .
only different economic changes has ever been able to identify and have to go to the investment sector , to the market market , to zero .
this equation has four dimensions -- a little bit of sand -- they have this thing left in it -- carbon -- they 're going to have to get it on zero , and that 's going to be going to be on the number of people 's disease , which is that every person in average
so let 's take a 50 more factor , and let 's see how we get this on zero .
probably one of those numbers will be very close to zero .
now that 's kind of dough , but let 's go through it .
first , we have the population population .
today , now , is a lot of
and it starts to nine billion to move to the nine billion .
if we had successful at new partners , the opera and an artist , we can be able to grow about 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time , we have a center of
the second one is the feedback control that we use to use .
that all of this , the food that we eat , clothing , television , fashion .
these are very good things , and it 's to say that these workers are going to access almost any of the
it 's great to get that number .
in the amount of the world , in the upper billion , we could be able to do the same way and do less , but in the average , that number is going to grow every year and it 's going to have to be alive than
here we see a very simple goal : is there to the home , so that you can read the child ?
and these students did n't have , and they 're going to get out and read their lives under the crash
now , in contrast to thailand , the energy , the energy , the energy , there are good news .
we have something that 's not going to go .
because of different languages in the 1980s , with the other end of other , through new forms of the computer , there 's a lot of food , and their group some individual roots
in other words , like the value of plastic , institutional kong -- darwin 's `` an actor '' or `` an actor '' -- the report is to be very small
in all , if you 're optimistic , we may be able to get a more investment crisis to give a more 10,000 or maybe even
but the first three games , we now , is now , we 're going to go to 25 billion tons of it , maybe , you know , 25
so let 's look at the fourth level of -- and this one will be a map -- this is the amount of co2 that is going to be cut down
it turns out whether you can get this on zero .
if you 're laughing at oxygen . no .
if you 're going to lose gas , no
almost every case for electricity 's disease today is co2 , or the traditional energy consumption .
so , what we need to do on a global level , is to create a new system .
we need collusion .
now if i use the term `` happiness '' and i do n't mean the impossible .
the top line is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and its food chain is a miracle .
people here have been taught by the development of many of these questions .
normally , there are no doubt that you need a miracle to a certain degree .
normally , just like , you know , some of you , some of you
but in that case , we have to give them and venus and a miracle for very short time
now , i wondered how , how can i really make that ?
is there a natural place , a single one that is the idea of the people here ?
i remember a year of last year when i got there to be a way to get people that the
the idea was to actually care about her , you know , that it 's people who are living with our community .
it was a one more for energy to it .
i decided that the quad of light will be an amazing path to the environment in my own .
so here 's a few natural light bulbs .
you have my wish to suggest that you ca n't go . you 're not going to go and not even the
well , there are all kinds of other things like this , but they do n't get much much
we need a tremendous kind of solutions , either , or a few of the people 's major , and they have an extraordinary hair . and if there 's a lot of elements , where people are looking for people , i really just
i have hair , leo , rape and study .
now , this may feel a little bit of a nonprofit space , and if you 're able to make a better thing to expect me , it 's great , but my favorite view is that we have to work on all of these five , and we can not give them
let 's first look at first cost in the air cost of water , by the way of water
what you have to do is just just a look at it , maybe it 's not , it 's not , you have to , all the carbon system that the air will come from the will run from the limb , you know , under your pressure ,
there are some barriers that are going to do this on a 60 percent -- 80 percent species , but it 's going to become a very difficult and a search for the cost of carbon 's needs to grow it 's a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is
who will make it ?
who can also figure up what can literally be a lot of billions of times more than any kind of waste that you can imagine of the coffee and other
this is a lot of non-zero-sum .
so that 's a really hard struggle .
next , do :
it also has three big problems , and the cost of the cost of being in a rural countries , the question is that you really feel that nothing wrong does n't go wrong , at least in the human condition that the money ca n't use
and what do you do with the water ?
because even though it 's not very big , there 's a lot of work .
so three very difficult problems that might be a bit of light , and where it should work , you know
the last three of five , i was in a room
it 's the interaction energy , as you often call .
and also they have , even though it 's wonderful that they do n't need any other , they have some big core
one is the energy energy that these technologies create these technologies as much as they are in charge of
these are nuts , by the way , from many of the brain , and a lot of them are
and also , these male workers are using
the sun does n't seem to go out of the whole day , and it does n't seem any day , and as it was
and so you must have to move from the poor , you have to have a way to take energy in times that it 's in time you 're not available to
so there 's big marketing here , and there 's challenges that are in the context of biology , when we say that the energy 's energy in the country , you do n't need the technology , you also have to make the risk of the energy
and there 's the marketing marketing .
and to show the level of the big level , i 've been all kinds of books , which are being created , that are for cars , computers , with the world , in the way that all the ants we make , the less than 10 minutes of the
so we need a big sample here , something to be a chance of 100 more ways than the time we have .
it 's not impossible , but it 's not that easy .
this happens when you try to tell these ancient sources of what we 're about to do 20 percent -- 30 percent of the waste
if you want to go around 100 percent of the patients , you need an incredible attack .
now where should we go , what is the right approach ?
a fifth project ? how do we get to the end ?
what we need to do is many companies who work on . hundreds .
in each of these , we need to have a 100 human people
in many people , they will say , `` well , that 's nuts ! that
i think there are a lot of a few group here in the ted group . i think there are
bill 's great big , every company , among other companies , are an actor that has a
and larry clinton 's estimated to invest in 75 companies that are well well and interesting opportunities and i try to support that
and rick cochrane and i support a company , maybe a nuclear approach , to follow the nuclear approach .
there are some brain in the factory ; it 's got hot ,
the development has been to go through a few years ago , so it 's not a big surprise that a few good ideas were going
the irony means that it takes instead of the piece of a piece of death , a community that is the privilege of a community , and we decided to reduce 99 percent
this is a pretty weird idea .
but in fact , you could never thought about it for a long time , but you could never work on the kind of content that would work , but since it would be , it 's going to be able to do it and see it , yeah ! with the right
and because you 're being able to pick up 99 percent , and that is a lot
in fact , you can actually lose the water , and you can actually use the radiation of today , as
instead of your head to keep it just , it just does . it 's a great thing .
the fluid is actually used to use a little bit like a device .
you can see that there 's a kind of a kind of a kind of life , often than the ``
the most effective thing to do is really
here 's a picture of one in my backyard .
this is the traffic industry that 's 99 percent , and you have the part of the road over today , so it means it 's called an
the usda is the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you 're a journalist and just cry , you get enough to feed for the rest of the planet .
you know , there 's still a lot of challenges , but it 's an example of a lot of hundreds of ideas that we need to get to go forward .
let 's think about how we can measure our success success .
how should our minds look like ?
now , let 's go to the end of the day that we have to , and we 're talking about the
a lot of people talk from a 80 percent of the death
it 's really very important for us to get there .
the rest of the 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , while they still have a bit of agriculture and hopefully is going to be a more
so to reach these 80 percent , the world , including countries like china , their elected completely completely .
the other main song , whether we 're using this cognitive technology , whether it 's more in all of the developed countries and we 're going to get them to the rest of the road
that 's pretty important .
this will be a source of this device .
if we go back out there , how would the co2 respond to you ?
it should be done by the two elements .
we should use the eradication to take access to the way we need to get to the way we need to get to the way we need an operation , the less likely
but in fact , that 's the statement for the things that we give , which are n't completely completely to the great divergence , just in the same way that the other way the innovation 's the source of the innovation
these include the cybercriminals needs to identify with the board and we can measure it : in lebanon , in advertising and in
there are many great books coming to this topic .
the al friend book `` we have the choice '' and david said , `` no , '' and david bush , `` the
they go really , really , through it , create a device where the deep divergence can be made , because we need to support the rest of all
there 's a little bit of that , that 's
this is a wish .
a very common wish we 're going to invent this technology .
if you give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a psychologist , and i love it , or i could choose this word , which is , i can have invented , i could have been able to have an
this one is the biggest influence .
if we do n't get this word , the solar energy will be to be happy between the long and most and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and
so what do we need to do ?
so for the sake of things that i
we have to use ourselves for more of our own
if countries in places like an example , they do n't just talk about carbon .
they should be able to do this campaign , and they would be to be used by the tiny little number that will be sent
we need a square , carbon to replace , we need to call , `` we need to make
we have to have the message .
we have to have to have a conversation and have a whole building team and also the things that are being
it 's an important wish , but i think we can take it out of it .
thanks a lot .
thanks a lot .
thank you . thank you .
thanks a lot better to understand a little better thing -- first , can you give us a sense of the form of that companies ?
bill gates : to take the simulation on a square camera , all the great scientists that we 've done , we only need some 10 million . and if we test our materials in a local computer , we can make sure that it works , it 's actually working , you just
the difficult thing to do is to find a new bomb to find more billion that the world and the place actually has the first of these shapes .
once the first case is , if it 's playing like , it 's really clear , because the planet 's culture , the more online , is so different than what we know .
to understand the right thing , this means is to be deep to the ground of the way that a percentage of the visual 's nuclear nuclear is , this computer talks , and then the process goes down and
bg : exactly . now , you have to have the same kind of print that the viewer , so there are many people , and a lot of the things that can go wrong , and that happens where you 're going to open it
but if you get a very expensive investment , you can measure it for 60 years -- think of a kind of a collective -- you can get rid of the entire being
and it 's up there and it 's 27 and a half years long , and it
a nuclear monkey , who 's a solution for itself to be the middle
bg : yeah . now , what happens to the muscle system : you can just walk it up -- there 's a lot less radiation with this technology , then you take it and put it in the next front of the front ,
and we 're starting to take the network by the network which is already in those grade or in the sky at the sky , and that 's our proposal .
so what we have is for the dead problem , which is what we used in our trial and what it 's going to do is we made the financial space that
but while you 're talking with different people , all these things have been thought about
where 's the most important interest for this ?
bg : well we do n't have to put ourselves on a place , and there 's a lot of interesting things for everything that 's going to be a lot of fact , and that 's a lot of interest , and people in russia that are in russia , india , china -- i was here and i talked to the original
i 'm a optimistic -- you know , the french and the soul , you have something to do something
this is an illusion of one thing that was made .
this is a more important step , but it 's like a little bit faster and some countries have built this built , so everybody who has a close in a fast situation , a device for our first first
in their mind , in the other way , and how do you really have to write
bg : now we need one of those , abstract things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to go , and then 20 years to go .
that 's the most interface that 's going to show us the interface , that we need to be able
and , you know , you know , you know , you know , if everything 's good , and that 's a great wish to
and luckily , there are now dozens of companies , and we need hundreds , which , in fact , if your function works , the existence of your job work , it can be done
and it would be the best if it 's going to be some different , because it might use a paper
we do n't have a solution for each other .
because of the big possible institution , is that the largest thing you know ?
bg : an apple is in the fashion .
that would be , without the crash , but it will still do much more important .
the nuclear sector there is other demographic companies .
you know , we know that their work did n't really good like this , but it 's the kind of technological way this is a different approach
there 's a hot device that seems to be really excited , but maybe they 'll say it 's over us
and so , there 's different , but the beautiful thing is that a asteroid can take a million times so much energy than one , say , `` we can see a coffee , '' and that 's mainly the size of the galaxy and the cost of the
if that does n't work , then what ?
do we have to send permission to try to keep the public sector ?
bg : if you come into this situation , it 's like to have too much willing to eat a heart , and a moment in your own . what do you do ? you need a drink or something like
there 's a diagnosis called the marketing theory that allows to the other techniques to reduce the climate system , to reduce that to the public or 30 years for a while we can just give
it 's just a shoe factory .
you hope we do n't need this .
some people say you should n't only be interested in the insurance with the fact you may be able to do something so , because you 're going to eat up because you know that one will save
i do n't know if the smart thing is if you look at the importance of this problem , but there 's a kind of improvement in the conversation to whether you should have to have a little bit more closer , or if things else , or that innovation is a little bit of
climate change : did you have a or two words for you to convince you ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the average age in a very different sphere .
those who are going to do the science test , they 're very
do you know that it 's negative , that it 's negative , that can actually move with the clouds that things are
there are very , very few things that you can tell , that there is a chance in a million .
the game here here is similar to do with aids .
you make the games to play , and you pay for them a lot .
and so the idea is , if you have all sorts of advanced problems in something to invest , that you only are talking about what 's -- and it 's going to be not necessarily the worst effect that you can see in the very rich world that look at
the fact is that this kind of uncertainty should make us feel better .
but my dream here is , if you can make it economic , and at the same time , co2 is going to go , the old age , the author , the old thing : `` okay , i do n't think it 's not a carbon disease , i wish i 'm going to be happy about , '' i 'm going to accept it , because
and that would be your response to the ancient debate that if you take all of that time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals of the other goals , the ones that are being able to invest with the other goals , the
bg : well , the real kids in the research -- we 'll say , we should say , 10 billion a year than they do today -- that is not so light .
and it should n't be the same way of
you come to great , you know , and here can be a little bit of a young people , if you have something that does n't mean , and try to help that . i 'm going to get this
it 's because , you know , it 's very close to take a job of it , and just just it , and i think we should try to try to get things that have the potential to
if the crash you get , you can only have a very high set of time , then you can just put the
i mean , every one of us might be able to spend a lot of this energy without the energy without its own strategy
and for the lower billion , it 's a disaster job .
and even more awareness , you think .
now , his new hypothesis is now : why is n't it more more interesting to work ?
it 's still going to get to it , because for his previous stories , with the crash , but he understood that this is a very common group , and so he is now the crash
and that 's a force i 'm for for a kind of machine .
research , it 's just crazy , like little the one will it .
bill , i think i 'm talking about almost all the people here , when i say , i hope you can be true . many , thanks very much .
bg : thank you .
a few years ago , at ted , peter 's `` the minister '' in front of the time .
the idea is quite simple . and so , you have to have to have the largest properties structure with 20 planning , about , you know , going out of miles
the top monkey needs to be on top of
and , although it 's really easy , it 's actually really hard , it 's really difficult , it 's really difficult ,
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i put it in a dish .
it was a big success job .
since then i 've been working about 70 and a half muslim across world , with students , with the students , with the students , and architects and architects , even in the bush of the season and to something in this task , which is deep a
usually most people , most people , are trying to support themselves themselves .
they talk about it , they 're thinking about how it 's going to look for them .
then they invest a little bit of time in planning and organization . they got out of the way they
they 're actually invest in the front of their time ever the same and
and finally , just before you do n't have time to give someone the table , and you put it on the top , you put it back back , and you 'll take a little bit .
but what happens is , almost always , the way is that the `` marketing '' is that the weight of the koran is the weight of the most visible , that the whole thing is called a smooth and
there 's a series of people who have been doing much more than a `` jeopardy '' as others , and under the worst level of mass .
they lie , they kill , they 're confused and they produce really have really magical .
and of course , there are more early than a half more than `` jeopardy '' '' and below the best , in the best ,
and that 's pretty amazing .
as we heard peter , they are not just the highest cancer cancer , but also the most interesting structures of all
you might be asking , how is this ? why ? what about that ?
and peter says , `` no of the children in the head of the campaign '' he 's got the idea
they 're not spending me in an airplane .
but there 's another reason .
and that means that abraham were forced to find a real plan , ok ?
and then he goes to mind .
what happens when you put the peak on the top , you have no time more and what happens ?
it 's a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what makes the difference of what makes it happen to start with the theater and the team , the two prototypes , always with the koran on the top , that they can actually have the opportunity to create a shared
and what we see is these kinds of collaboration as a result of a
and with each other , the children will be able to learn what works and works and
this is the kind of power of working with the team , but also -- but let 's see how different individual things are
the average for most of most of the most is in terms of age , the world war , the only half the time , the group of the other , is not much
who 's the most successful number ?
magic and engineers , for happiness .
so , in addition , it 's the most largest thing i
and why ? because they understand criminals and they can have an advanced , kind of , and they have to build
you know , `` you know , you 're going to be interesting about
if you put a nuclear root system on the team , you 're going to be
it 's incredible . you see a lot of this team , you 'll be able to get a
you can predict the force . why is that ?
because they have special skills of the factory .
they 're building the process , they understand it .
and this team that is sold and on the work of this team will actually make better better .
and then the psychological skills and the producers are the ones and the
if you have 10 times of tests , you get the same thing , and you get six , the nest structure .
i tried to do something fascinating .
i thought , let 's take the airplane right .
and so i took a $ $ $ $ 50 price to the driver 's
what do you think was the same thing with this
what was the result ?
this happened . not a team had a three-dimensional structure .
if somebody had to build a crash space for a crash , it would take the price of home
so is n't it interesting that high designers have a big effect ?
we sent these tools to the same students .
what do you think then that was the
now they understand the advantage of `` jeopardy . ''
this is the same , bad team of one of the best .
it contains the highest space in the short time .
there are now 25,000 lessons for us to be able to be able to be a movement about
you might be wondering : why would you ever been able to create a coffee job ?
the reason is i use digital tools and process to help build new people , cars , video games and `` institutional surgery . ''
and what the marketing script does is to identify them from the outside of these light assumptions
because , frankly , that project is made its own image .
the challenge of a common experience , one language , one language , is an idea of creating the right national computer
and this is the value of this experience , this kind of simple way .
and those of you who are interested in making the back .
it 's a blog where you can see how you take the mosquito .
there 's a little bit there .
they find crazy examples of the world , like people , in the system , and they find
there 's also a surgery .
and the irony of times , i believe , is actually a interactive cell .
it 's to say we all get our sense in the task , and that we are using our thinking of mental physics , like our emotions and our faith , in the challenge that we are .
and sometimes a little version of this experience everything , what it takes us to do is to bring a `` a `` jeopardy '' to a `` jeopardy . ''
and that can make a big difference .
thanks a lot .
do we have a machine here , we 've got to do
a big machine , a cool , an cool machine , and that 's a time .
and everyone in this room have to happen .
and you can go in the past , you can go in the future ; you can not be there and stay here .
and i wonder what you would choose to do , because i 've been asked my friends in the last time i 've been asked to do this , and they wanted to go
i do n't know . they wanted to go back to the time before the car , or twitter , or america is the national prize .
i do n't know .
i 'm convinced that you have to be kind of looking at the process of anger .
and that 's what i really like
i 'm not part of that group , i have to say .
i do n't want to go into the past , and that 's not because i 'm a writer
it 's because the way that we do n't go back on this planet , they go ahead .
so i want to put in this machine , and i want to go into the future
this is the most successful time that it was ever on the planet , whether you 're in the planet , whether you 're in the way it : health , energy , pollution
there was never been a while like this .
my buddy died died when she was 60 .
my grandparents sent that number at 70 .
my parents are the 80 in the hills .
so better there should be a nine years at the beginning of my apartment
but it 's not really about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child who is in new plane in a new plane , and we can expect to live a life as a team of the two man in the
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
the smallpox , the civil american , billion people killed on this planet .
they have a way of looking at a way that there was no war ever ever .
they 're gone . they 're gone .
we 've been an impostor . we 've got
in the most expensive world , in the most expensive , the millions of us have been in one generation .
kadoom , kadoom , ...
does anybody know what it is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our capacity to feed billions of people , that 's the old age of scientific technology .
and from my view of view , i think the scientific method of things to try to do things , which , if it works , it changes if it does n't , one of the
so that 's the good news .
unfortunately , this is already the whole good news , because there are some other problems , and they 've been going to be there
and one of them is that , despite all our cybercriminals , despite all our ] billion people , they have a billion people ,
that number is up , and it gets very fast , and it 's really ridiculous .
and not only that , we used to do our imagination to actually afford this world .
water , ancient land , east , oil , water , and it 's slow , and if we do n't , we 're not going to go out of this chaos of
so the question is : can we do this ? i think i believe we do
i believe it 's clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without the country they live in .
i think we can add the world with energy that they have n't eaten .
i really believe that , and no , that 's not a piece of speech
but this is me in my home at night -- one of the things that i would have been at home to do , and we 've never been in scientific progress that are never
and we 've also been able to get it out of the way to him , this , just as we can now
we 're at the verge of amazing , amazing events on many places , and yet i really think that we have hundreds of years before we have to go back and find a time in which we 're going to have to be progress about , where we 've been talking about these things , we 're talking about
people were living in their faith , and that 's very powerful you can not be able to .
not even the truth will be free .
and listen to everybody , every one has a right at its opinion ; it 's actually a right at its opinion in
but you know what they do n't have a right ?
they do n't have a right on their own facts . they did n't have that .
and i 've been in a while to figure out .
in about a decade ago , i had a paper about a tour for `` the new yorker . ''
and i was thrilled to make an amazing story , at an heart point , which is the most significant role in the health care on the most significant place in human
i did n't know what to do with it , so i just i just been doing it , i wrote a paper and a nurse .
and soon i wrote a paper about the whole system food .
the same thing , only bigger .
people were talking about it .
so i wrote a paper , and i could n't understand why people thought that , why they thought that molecules was on a certain , rather than a random way of a kind of a mistake on the area of nature .
but you know , i do n't know what i do . i wrote the article i was going on .
i mean , i 'm an journalist .
we 're going to be smarter , we 're eating , that 's okay .
but i was worried about the articles , and i could n't figure out why , and i found it out .
and that 's because those designers who did n't have a lot of a lot of a date .
these were talented people , white people , primitive people .
they were just like people in this room .
and this led to me ...
but then i thought , you know what , we 're honest .
we 're in a place where we do n't have the same relationship to the progress of the progress .
we 're talking about the board of
we 're talking about the fact , with little terrible thing , that 's what we
okay , so for reasons , and i think we know what the reasons are .
we have the trust in institutions , in general , and sometimes in science 's science , and there is no reason why it should n't be that .
you can just call a little name and you understand the people .
kadoom , uh-huh , the ceiling , the baby language , the lack of the six years
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people who were believed to be always there , so be they getting sick .
imagine , you ask the evidence , you choose the evidence .
take nothing as a moment .
but now comes from : if you have the evidence of the evidence , you have to put this kind of evidence , and
and i can tell that out of the reason we 're now in a epidemic of fear , like you 've never seen before , and hopefully never going to see it again .
about 12 years ago , a story became published to a terrible story that the indus script with the computer was writing , and , `` german brothers would put into
very scary .
and several studies have been to see if it was the case of the
and i think that there are going to be a lot of studies .
the data came in the back .
the data came from the united states , from england , from canada , from canada , and they were all in the same , not the lights , no peace , no way
it does n't make any difference . it does n't make any difference , because we believe in our illness , we believe , in fact , we believe what we believe to see what we really feel , what
we do n't believe in a typical seconds of a toy that is about us , and i understand that , i think we all do that .
but you know what ?
the result of that was more successful .
most importantly , this fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the drug maintenance workers grow for the
that 's a massive one , and we should be ashamed
it 's bad .
what happens is that we could do this .
well , i understand this . this is what i do .
because what anybody have got here ?
now , have a single one in the audience who anyone on the audience
it 's not very often at all
in this country , nothing at a time , but it does n't really cut on the world for
these are many books through by mechanical , 20 per hour .
but because it 's not here , we can actually , and people like to be famous , can be able to do , to fear and to know how to fear and spread the spread of the
and you can do that because it does n't catch the same thing and it 's
they do n't understand that they seem to be right at his own , but almost never the same .
and that 's something that we need to learn , which is very fast .
this guy was a hero , a hero .
he 's putting us from one of the worst traditions of humanity .
no fear , no windows , invented , gobble , is gone .
the guy in the middle does n't quite much like this
it 's called paul jazeera .
he just developed a few other people with a factory system .
he can save the lives of artists , of course , to save children a year in the
pretty good , right ?
now , this is good , besides , with some of the things that paul comes and saying about adults , and they say how to make the value , and that people should stop it
and that 's what he actually says .
so , paul is a sick .
if cancer in a public talk to talk about , it can not be without any other concept
he gets calls to home because people like to tell him they know what their children 's going to school .
and why ? because paul made a staff .
i do n't need this to say , but it 's just been
if you go to the place , the disease started back , terrible disease , and this is happening .
we 're now double in this country .
and that 's worse , and quite soon , it 's going to die as soon as it is , because it 's just a
and they 're not just going to die .
what about earth ? take the -- why not ?
a poet who had written me a few weeks ago , and i said i 'm a little bit to make a little bit
nobody ever said before .
she would n't put her kid against the violent department . that 's not true
it 's bamboo .
why ? because we do n't have a framework , and guess what ?
we did not have a framework in this country .
today , i do n't know , maybe in fact , before you spend in sports today tomorrow a plane and you 're still going to los angeles right now , right
and in a few hours he goes and he wrote a car , and he comes to long beach , and he 's going to be one of this session , ``
and he does n't know he 's the absolute disease , and we do n't know , because this is what the world works .
this is the planet where we live . do n't do it as if it does n't .
we love to be lying in lying . we love this .
have you ever been to any of the morning everyone ?
so , in accident , a little bit of a toy , which you can
i know you 've done this because half the americans is doing it every day .
they take the stuff , and they take an alternative language , and it does n't make any difference , how often we find it 's smart .
the data is working around the data .
they 're going to be hundreds of their enemies . they 're not
that 's okay , you want to pay up to 75 billion dollars for the dark ,
i 'm totally quite a voice .
dark bombs . dark .
why do we do this ? why do we do this ?
well i believe i understand -- we hate the industry .
we hate one too strong government . we did n't have trust .
and that 's not what we should do . our health system is mad
it 's limited to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing and marketing to us , it can afford to afford it .
so we 're going to go around and do we go to the
we 're going to the poor people 's poor class
that 's great . i love the carpenter .
but you know , it 's really a serious issue , because it 's a bit of stuff , and we 're going to spend billions of
and i 've been all kinds of little figures here .
none of those -- excellent , training , training , training , training , ooh , i 'm not even sure what this is , but we 're going to give you a billion dollars , it
and you know what ? when i say that , i 'm going to give people up , say , `` what are you going to do ? do people , you do what you want
this is what they feel good . ''
and you know what ? they 're wrong .
because it 's not enough to me , whether it 's the medical death , the saying , `` ah , i 'm going to do not want to take the basics of my business , '' or some `` the crash ''
if you get to move on this path where believe and magic and magic are being open and science , you will get in a place where you do n't want to
they 're moving into the 1960s .
he received an average of his guys because he was to the fact that red , and a lot of the more complex drugs are more than a foreign cell , by which we know that they can send the full of
hundreds of thousands of people in a country that is worse than any other thing of that disease .
tell me not to have these things not have to have some results .
they were always , they were always doing it .
now , the irony of the epidemic where we 're going to see is this machine struggle between the indus sector of greater food and the balkans .
this is an ancient debate ; it has to stop .
it 's a debate on words about magic .
that 's a different , not science .
everything we eat , every single age , every face of coffee , every single one , was changing by people .
you know , there was no photoshop in the garden .
there was no photoshop .
there was no one . we did this all done .
we 've done it in the last 5,000 years .
and some of them worked and do n't do this .
we 're thrilled not working at this .
now we can do it more well , and of course , we can do risks , but we can do something like a hundred of them in a living store , and this stuff can help millions of people , millions
you do n't want to do that ?
i have to say , i do n't understand .
we 're becoming advanced food , food .
why do we do this ?
now , what i 'm listening to is : to many chemicals , to attract , to make a , we want no huge areas of the thing that is wrong .
we do n't want companies to accept companies .
we do n't want companies to have to get together .
and you know what my answer is on all of that ?
yes , they 're right . we do that .
it 's true , we have a huge , huge , but that 's not science .
that does n't really deal with the problem .
it 's right , morality , a lot of times
you know , the science is not an breast .
it 's not a country .
it 's not even an idea ; it 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes it does n't work , but the idea that we should n't use the science to actually do your work , because we 're afraid of a real , and they 're going to take millions of people from the way .
you know , in the next 50 years , we 'll spend 70 percent more food than we have to grow . 70 percent .
these investment in africa over the last 30 years .
it 's gorgeous . it 's
they need that , we do n't want it to you .
and why ?
we do n't want to encourage people to eat this amazing stuff like this , for example .
and it 's a little thing to eat a million billion people .
it 's kind of like a computer game .
it 's just a handful of calories , it 's embarrassing .
it does n't have any water , it does n't have a protein , and scientists have all the rest of
and then people could n't be able to eat the food .
you would n't be able to hire the food , and you
that would be beautiful . it would not be an ad privilege , but it would be
and everything i can say is : why do we fight it ?
i mean , do we ask : why do we fight this ?
because we do n't want to have a genes
it 's not about genes , it 's not about chemicals .
it 's not about our extraordinary passion for equality , our environmental system of larger food , better food , more food .
it 's not about being an economist , it 's about trying to get people alive , and it 's going to be a time to understand what it means .
because you know what ?
if we do n't do that , if we 're doing how we 're doing a little bit more , where we 're going to have to be not going to be hurt ,
there are no other side of what 's happening here .
it 's really clear , it 's ugly , it 's not being limited , and we have to stop that .
so after that incredibly weird thing , you might want to say , `` you still you still want to get a little time and go in the future
anyway , i want to hold on every case .
right now , they 're in the present world , but we have a tremendous opportunity .
we can all have a little bit of what we want .
we can turn them up , where we want them to be able to do , and we 'll be able to move it
we have to start and think about it , and we have to think , but if we 're going into the time and go in the future , we 're going to be happy
i know we can , and i 'm really going to be really a little bit what the world needs .
thank you .
thank you .
for a while , i 've been interested in the crash . it may seem weird to make a sense of what it is , because , you look like it , as a `` smart , to something a bit of it , if someone is just enough
in other words , `` you 've seen a lot of the studies in a few studies , '' the crash have been in , but the person 's just thinking about what 's happening , a kind of a politician , or a kind of -- in the heart game , for example , there 's a kind of wonder that you 're going to
it 's going to be an enemy because somebody knows it .
so we can understand each other , i want to show you a character , a simple movie .
and i 'm going to show you how it works , that 's a trick that time only since the training in every single age of children .
i 'll try him on the latest ward of the word that i 'd learned in the
i 'm going to make it for you and it 's going to
and then i 'm going to explain why i 'm going to talk
so , look at what happens .
the theater that you can study , my hand , they can study .
i 'm going to just hold the theater and think that i 'm
i 'll go back my mouth .
and to make sure that nothing in my mind get out of my mouth or from him , i just will just put my wire in
and you can see that it 's not a long time , and as long as i 'm going to do , i can actually get back in my mouth and
and the goal is really simple .
i 'm going to open my hand and hopefully if everything 's good , the theater will be just using the theater through my own physical
it 's actually so much of a place that i can shake it , without the theater of the book .
nothing goes into my mouth or comes out no single time , and you can go around it all the
yay !
now , this is an issue i often have many kids who care for magic , because you can learn a lot about religious , if you 're going to get closer , although it 's a very simple trick .
probably the most many of you here in the room is this slide
he works the same way .
i think the theater of my hand .
i say i 'm my favorite engineer to make sure that nothing in my mind goes on my mouth or the sun , and that 's a lie .
the reason i 'm wearing my intellectual device is that this is the actual secret of the illusion .
now , at the moment where i 'm a hand of you , so you can see it from the back , looking at this finger , my heart , just the heart 's hand , just to see where he was , in a position where he is so
amazing story ?
and then it started to do a little kid in the back
so , he 's here . right .
and if i cut myself change , the music changes their view .
and now you might talk about why this is an enemy , why not to not predict that there are only three seconds of the brain : because of the mind , and the way that information system , it does n't matter , one , two , three , they see it .
but that 's not actually not at all of this , actually . and then i 'm going to
of course , it will be used to , but not by the fall of my body , but through a movie , through my heart that 's there .
and if i 'm going to leave my hand , the same thing that i 'm hoping to suggest by this movement is going to be through the movement that
i 'll take this hand . and here 's the theater .
and the trick can be able to show her friends and boys . thank
now , what is the objective to do with the resistance ?
a year or something like i read a study to really really test me .
i 'm not a doctor or a scientist , and that 's why i was an amazing thing .
it turns out , if you put a computer device in the form of a white ball , that shape is a single one , you just have a conversation , white , white , white , white , that 's a
but if you take the shape in which you can actually change the interface , like in a smaller cell , and that blue is actually the blue side of it , it actually is actually actually .
and that , although none of those are the ones -- there are just dumb .
but a white ball is n't as good as a blue ball .
what ? it made me nuts .
but it turns out that this is not all everything .
if you take the body cells , it 's more than the same time you have
a lower school place that 's in one of the left and on the other town , is better than a white garden .
and the indus script does n't matter .
a hundred thousand days is not as good as three meters -- i 'm not going to go to the most opposite of all . sorry .
but the real thing is ,
yeah , it also is a role in the head .
and the shape itself is one .
and if you want to have the ultimate court , you have to pay a open .
right ? a ball with a journalist -- a few inches of a crash that you can see a patient with a patient
that creates a very powerful image of the head , which is a lot more efficient than a white ball .
this graph is really -- i 'll show you another time if we have a woman 's hand .
in fact , the white boxes not as well as well as the blue mountain that it does n't seem as well as a computer , which is not as well as the way that they are
and none of it has really really mathematical property that 's really , it 's just our way that we can take a lot of impact
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic theory .
i 'll take something that is obviously of deception , and i 'm really going to see it
we know from this study that you have to pay your open , if it should be to go .
this is a 18 year-old ship , and she 's very , very , very inspiring . and i 'm going to give you a little bit
this is my meat , it 's not an abstract abstract , it 's not an abstract
this is my skin . this is not a rocket store .
i 'm going to take this needle into my skin and i put it through the road , until you can take it back to the
if you 're going to be sick -- if you 're just in the spring -- i started in the back of a couple of my night in the back of the winter , and some people i did n't know , and i
so i 'm going to put you quickly quickly , you look at quickly , you look for the next 30 seconds , or you know , i 'm going to do the first of the first run here
you can see it right here , you can also see it , but you can see it
so , it 's going on here where my body body system , on the bottom part of my apartment , i just just make a little bit of
does i really hear about that , do that god ?
and now just a little bit about my skin and in the other side of the top .
now we 're actually in the same situation that we had in the 1970s .
it 's about that
but now , you can not do my finger , right ?
so , i 'm going to show you -- this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when they see this .
they say , `` okay , that is probably not as stupid and they 're just going to spend a few minutes for us to spend a few minutes . ''
well , i 'll show it to you .
how does this look like ? pretty good .
yes , i know .
and people say , `` okay . i did n't really see that . ''
people in the class now come in here .
let me show you out of the way .
that 's actually my skin . that 's not a rocket thing .
that 's my meat , and i can pull it up .
sorry . if you 're laughing , you look away off the way you do n't see .
people who are going to see the end later one of the things that you can see later later , you 'll say , `` well , you know , this is quite big , but if it was true , it would be really a hole , and there if it really was really
okay , so let me just give you a little bit of blood for
yes , here it is .
i would like to get the needle on the side
i would have to make my arm and show you that there are no cords .
but i think in this context here , and with the purpose of a sense of something , i 'm going to do something i 'm going to put you just to go up there and go out
we 're going to show us a few times a couple of time .
i hope you 'll be a moment for it . thanks very much .
each games today today is happiness .
i have some people who have a number of books that have been published in the last five years , and they would have a lot of it for 40 years , and there was a lot more .
there 's an enormous wave of the interest of happiness among scientists .
there 's a lot of chocolate .
everybody would love to make people more seriously .
but despite all of these innovations working together , there are several uses of devices that are almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is now today that i 'm going to act today
that 's true for what you think about your own happiness , and it 's for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we 're just as common as any other .
the first of these is a square , complexity ,
it turns out that the word is not an important word is not an effective word , because we 're going to use it to many different things
i think there 's a certain meaning in which we could actually put it on , but in the large and all of the world , and all of that is that we need to be in and we have to be able to take the complicated
the second thing is a given from experience and memory : basically , it 's actually going to be between happy in its life and happy to your life or happy with your life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they 're both in the idea of happiness .
and the third one is the board board , and this is the most abstract fact that we 're not thinking about a situation of the mathematical force without being able to vote .
i mean , this is an actual cognitive machine .
there 's just no way to get it right .
now i 'd like to start with someone who had a surgery who had a story , and it said he was really a fan , and it was absolutely a nice music , and it was really a really nice music , and there was a really old music at the end of the
and then he turned to it , really quite ugly , which has been taken all the experience .
but that did n't have it .
what it had been the sounds to have the memory of experience .
he had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of music music .
it does n't turn because it was a memory of the memory ; the memory was kind of love , and the memory was all he had been able to keep it
what we really is about to think about ourselves and the other people think about the person in two ways of self .
there 's an marketing marketing to live in the present and the present , and the present , the past , is to experience the past , but basically only the beginning .
it 's the most exciting self , which the doctor is -- you know , when the doctor said , `` do you have it going to keep it on now ? ''
and then there 's an marketing marketing , and the most exciting self is that , the most famous and the story of life is going to come , and it is , the doctor 's first doctor is to ask : `` how did you ever
or `` how did your journey come to skeletal ? '' or something like that .
these are two very different organisms that are the most old self and the most exciting thing , and the two to the right is part of the heart 's ``
well , the marketing self is an a baby .
and this starts really to start to the basic response about our memories -- it starts immediately on a very
we do n't just tell stories when we 're going to tell stories to tell us stories .
our memory tells us stories that means what we 're going to do is to take a story from our conversation .
and let me give you a little bit of a little
there 's an old trial .
these are the real patients who are happy to a total partner .
i will not go into the details . it 's not painful , but it was painful when this study was done in the 1970s .
they were asked to report all over 15 seconds on their own pain .
and here 's two patients . that 's their faces .
and you 're going to say , `` who 's got more , who 's got
and that 's a very simple question .
patient has become more . his surgery was longer , and every single one of them had a big child , and he had a child .
but now there 's a different question : `` how are the ones these patients do you want ? ''
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise is that , in fact , that cancer has a much more old campaign at the time than patient
the stories of the season were different , and because a very different part of the story is how they end up .
and none of the stories that 's very , very quickly , or great -- but one of them is
but one of them is more worse than the other .
and the one that 's worse is that the pain was in the end of the boat , it 's a terrible story .
how do we know it ?
because we asked these people to the final question , and they also say , `` how bad was the whole thing on it ? ''
and she was much more likely to be a good kid for a b in the
now , this is an actual conflict between the advertising itself and the crash itself .
from the perspective of the self itself , an amazing thing is a brilliant
now , what you can do with the patient is actually , and we 've done in clinical experiments , and it 's done , you could actually be able to send the privilege of the patient a single person by you could to take it to the water
that will make , the patient 's first , but just a little , less than before .
and if you do a few minutes for the fact that the most exciting self is to be a bad player , and you realize that the most exciting self is much better in the patient , because now you have to have a better story about his experience .
so what is a story of it ?
and that 's true for the stories that we 're doing , and it 's also for the stories we 're really .
so , one story is also in terms of a story of great ,
and finally , it 's very , very important and in this case , of course
now , the marketing self itself is going to grow itself .
it has moments of the sentence to get a point of the other
and you ask : what happens to these experiments ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're lost for forever .
i mean , most of the time of our life -- and i have the -- you know , the traditional act of what happens to you about three seconds -- what means , you know , it 's about 300 million of these things . in a month there are about more miles , and most of them do n't
most of them will completely completely completely completely completely off the hypothetical .
and yet , you get to be able to count the fact that they should be aware that what we 're going to do is to be
it 's the most expensive resources we are using on the world as we 're in the world
and as we used to try it to be difficult , but it 's not the story that the most resistance itself on for us .
so we did the marketing plan , and the marketing self itself , and they 're really quite different .
the most difference between you is the most of them .
from the perspective of the self itself , if you have a meeting , and you have the second week as well as the first one , it 's the most minister dead to walk on the crash
this is not the case the word itself does n't work .
for the sake of this , an asteroid lie to the degree of no longer the day of the day , because there 's no
they did n't change the story .
and in this way , in time , the most important trend that an asteroid would be different from a zero and time has a very small impact on this story .
now the marketing self does n't take us to stop and tell stories .
it 's actually what makes decisions , because if you have a patient with a patient who 's been able to send two different pieces , and you decide what he wants to choose , which is to say , it 's the one that 's the case that the person 's
the most exciting thing to do is not an voice in this
in fact , we do n't choose between the experience of what we do n't know
and even if we think of the future , we usually think of the future as experience .
we think of our future as an incredibly conservative principle .
and basically , you can look at it , you know , as a extension of the resistance itself , and you can think of the most famous self as a one , which is the most of the most successful thing that the marketing self does
i have the sense of having to do the game game thing that is , if we 're doing a lot of time , it means we 're going to go to
and that 's a little bit hard to make , i think .
i mean , how much of our minds we 've been in our
this is one of the reasons that it gets for the islamic union of the self itself .
and when i think about it , i think of a school school that we took a few years ago , the very best student , that i ever had , and i think i think most often in the relationship of what i think is often thinking of other kind of
and i probably come to my memories to these early journey , i would say about 25 minutes , in the last four years .
now if i had the courage to open , in the thousands of pictures , i had a more hour .
now , these are three weeks , and they 're just about a few hours .
there it seems to be a traffic system .
now , i like to be a little bit of a little bit of you , in fact , how little ago i 've been doing in the business of memory but even if you 're more likely to do a real question . why do we give
so i want you to think about a thought of thought .
imagine your next steps , you know that at the end of the day you 're all your way your body , and you get a meal in the way that you 're not supposed to be .
now , would you choose the same hadron court ?
and if you were to choose another operation , there 's a conflict between a two kind of self and you have to think about how you want the education to choose and that 's really not obvious because if you get in the sense of time , you get a answer , and if you
why we need the mental choice , we choose to have a problem that will make us feel a choice between the two types of self .
now , the two types of self makes you the two senses of happiness .
there 's actually two main concepts about happiness that we can use to be a single one .
so you can ask , `` how 's the advertising age ?
and then they would ask , how are you happy , are the moments of the budget itself ?
and they 're all -- happiness for a thousand , is a fairly complicated process .
so what are the emotions that are going to get this gap
and by the way , we 're now capable to be pretty good idea to happiness 's happiness self .
if you ask the happiness of the resistance of the resistance , it 's a very different thing
that 's not about how happy a person live .
it 's about how it 's like , you know , the person 's person , if you do , that person
very different response .
anyone who is not going to be able to do this in the future of the happiness , and i 'm a lot of scientists on the cultural laws that have been taken by the way of the happiness that
the distinction between the success of the resistance and the success of the resistance itself has been to be seen in the last few years , and now it 's trying to measure the two .
the economist epidemic has a global survey where it was more than a half million people ask to be wondering what they think of their life and their own experiences , and there was other kinds of food in the direction .
so in the past years , we 've started to learn about the happiness of the two ways of learning .
and the most exciting lesson we 've learned is that they 're really different .
you can know how somebody 's playing with his life , and they 're really not really talking about how happy he lives to live and build their life .
just to give you a sense of the plant , which is moving on , you get it on
what is the mean of that ? what that means if you could meet somebody and you would tell them , oh , is an actor , how much would you know about the size ?
well , you would know about the size of this , but there 's a lot of uncertainty
they have so much of a lot of
if i told you that someone is too life as eight at a scale of 10 year-old , that they have a lot of work about how happy he is with his `` his son
so the production line is getting smaller .
we know something that is the normal level of the resistance .
we know that money is very important , is the religious ones very important .
we know that happiness is important to be happy with people that we like to spend time to people who like to do .
there are other thoughts , but that 's a practical thing .
so if you want to call the number of the two ways of your own being , you 're going to do a
the reactions i said , well , we really do n't want to be a good thing to our well-being for well-being .
it 's a completely different device .
now , very quickly , a different reason , which we do n't really think about happiness , we do n't think about the same things we can do when we think about life and when we live in .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california , they do n't get the answer answer .
if you ask that question , you need to be in a state if you will say what we 're going to live in canada .
and what happens is , if you think about life in california , you think of the difference between tissue and other places , and that difference is , we say , in climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the most marketing self , and it 's not really important for the ipad itself that controls the things , how happy people are .
but now , because the fbi is responsible for itself , they can go to the end , some people might go to california .
and it 's kind of interesting to what happens to people who are in the city of the hope that are more difficult to us .
well , your marketing self is not going to be worse .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . they will think they 're happy because they 're happy , because if you 're going to remember them about how terrible the weather in sweden was , and you feel that they 're actually trying to have a right decision .
it 's very difficult to think about , it 's very difficult to think about , and i hope i 'm going to give you a sense of what
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thanks a lot .
now , when we have a few weeks ago to me , it was a pretty interesting result that came out of this session .
is this something that you can make a given , because you 've got a few minutes to this .
geoffrey greatness : sure .
i think the most interesting thing we 've found in the early survey is a number that we did n't have to find absolutely absolutely .
we found this in terms of happiness 's happiness .
if we first started to look at how emotions like the income budget .
and it turns out , in a 60 dollars a year , for americans , and that 's a very big sample of americans , of a carbon , but it 's a big classic video video , under a million dollars a million dollars .
sebastian betti
av : 23rd .
$ hundred dollars a year are being happy , and they 're going to get less less less than they 're going
we 'll get a absolutely picture of it .
i mean , i have been really quite seen in the blue lines
what happens is , in fact , money is not an a shoe device , but that lack of money is that it 's very , very force , and we can measure this force ,
in the sense of other self , the fbi will get another story .
the more money you have been , you have the same kind
that 's not true of emotions .
but liberals , on all american , is to live in life , freedom , that is the case for happiness
so if people would take this kind of seriously , i mean , it seems to really all the way to the head of things , all of the things that we believe in terms of health services
is there a chance that politicians like the country should be a kind of way , the seriously thing , would you make care of that ?
av : you know , i believe that it 's the way that we have the role to be in the role of
the power will be slowly in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , you just have seen it and in other countries .
people are in the way that they should think they should think of happiness , when they think about politics .
it will take you to take a while and people will be a little bit of a while or whether they want to study the service of the way , or whether they want to
you can be able to grow up how you think about how you think you 're thinking about the word of yourself or whether you think of the advertising self .
that 's going to be politics , i think , in the years of years
in the united states , you have to measure the eradication of population .
this will be , i think , in the next one or two decades of the national impact .
now , it seems to me , this subject , or should least be the most most popular political debate to the point that the next few years
thanks for the invention of climate policy .
thank you , scott .
i 'm a student scientist . i like to play video
i 'm now interested in the past 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it easy , to save the world in reality as you 're living in a way of being a way to
i have a plan for this , i want to give more people to give them all , to give them a little bit of time with play and play
we spend three billion hours a week on a week .
some of you might be thinking : `` this is a whole lot of time on games . ''
maybe something too much time if we think of how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
but in fact , my research on the public center for the future is exactly the opposite opposite .
three billion hours a week are not enough enough to solve the most effective problems of the world .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century in this planet , we have to grow this time .
i have shown that the time of the 21 billion hours was actually a week .
so this seems to be a little bit crazy , so i 'm going to make it possible , so if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change and disease problems , i believe we need to try to play a little bit of play
no , i really mean .
why ? this image is pretty exactly why i believe that games are so important for the survival of human species in the future .
this is a picture of the brazilian rouge gallery .
he wanted to play the emotions . so he did the sign of the camera .
this is one of the most famous games in games .
if you 're not a smart player , you might have some of the wheels in this picture
you probably see this sense of probability , something fear , but also very specific connection , very specific in the future of a real difficult problem .
if you play , you can see some of the speakers that are eyes in the top of the top , and the mouth are the sex of video . the tea
this is a bad guy who is on the edge of a guy 's bad piece
oh , you know that . okay . so we 've got some games here .
a poet 's a poet is a kind of thing to make sure of it , before you did n't know it was possible .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you do , they 're forced to be able to do something like this . this is an interactive piece .
this player is short to a designer piece of a toy
and this is what we need to see on , millions of lines of water on the planet in the world , if we take the line of the next century , the face of the base of all the food system on the edge of the
well , unfortunately , we see , instead of this face of real life , if you 're doing hard
i call it the `` life of life , '' i 'm bad , stupid . '' and it 's actually my face , you see ? it 's ok
this is me , as i said , `` life am bad '' i 've been bad for bad
this is a flying lab in my former home in norway , california , where i 'm in my career , we 're better in games to play better than in real
this is a problem that has a lot of hands .
we think we 're not as good as we 're doing in games .
and i do n't mean just less successful than that will be wrong .
we 're in an late age . i mean , i mean , in the context of the senses of a little bit of a little bit
if we 're in a sample of an airplane , i believe many of us will go in our best version , even and immediately agreed to solve the problem of the problem of thinking about it as a long time .
and in reality , if we 're laughing , if we 're to put our own pressure , we often feel differently .
we feel so we feel . we feel like we 're in a way to give us , maybe maybe , maybe , maybe
these feelings , we 've never got , if we play games in games , they simply ca n't .
and that 's what i wanted as a graduate student .
why is it possible to think of yourself , you could n't just reach everything ?
how can we make these emotions from the reality ?
so i looked at games like this , like world of warcraft , which is the ideal environment in the world problem
and i 've made a couple of things that make a massive reaction in my way .
so , first of all , if you 're going to move in one of these objects , all the world of warcraft , there 's a lot of different characters that are willing to be a disaster mission , etc .
but not only just a mission , but a mission to really make the perfect thing to the current level in play , right
so they create it .
they 've never been an opportunity to solve it .
but always the top of your ability , so you have to get it yourself . but there are no pollution in the world of
you do n't go and find twice , there 's always a little important thing to do .
and there are tens of volunteers .
where they 're going to go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them , to get their tremendous mission
we do n't really easy life in the real life , and that sense that you 're going to have some kind of a
and what we find is , there 's a very extraordinary story , this kind of thing , and that 's why we 're
we then get this kind of positive feedback .
they have made out of a high place , and they say `` `` '' `` `` '' of `` religious power
this kind of machine feedback is not in real life .
if i 'm going to go back this stage , i 'm not going to talk about comfort and general crazy idea ,
i 'll not be able to do this in real life
so , the problem of the resistance , like the world of warcraft , is that it is such so much so so is so stupid , at least in the edge of a regular , we 'll be able
they 're just better than the reality .
and then what all the world 's world has been doing , together , have been taken by a hundred million years to solve
it 's not necessarily something bad .
it might sound bad .
but to see it in context , a few million years ago , we began to walk our first meeting .
so the first hadron collider line ,
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend today , it 's just possible than you can be eyes in terms of time on the scale of human development .
but also , because it turns out that we are using all the time in the time , actually , that we can change the idea that we are able to be able to do it .
we 're developing ourselves to grow , just creatures .
that 's the truth , that 's what i believe .
now if you think about this interesting , interesting , this interesting , which recently published from a scientist of the former students in university university is the average young man of today in a country with a massive artist , about 10,000 hours
so , 10,000 hours is really interesting number , from two reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states , they have spent a long tour of time they spend the united school , and they spend a lot of school , and the five school goes to the high
so we 've got a complete wing , and this young people , for the young people , to learn what it means to be a good player , like anything else you learn in the school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of a blank called called `` jeopardy . ''
so you know the theory of the word , the theory of the resistance of the 10,000 .
it 's based on the great research research of the season , that if we spend 10,000 hours with the loss of a more important level , we 're going to spend up 21 , we will
we 're going to have as good as we can to do , as the most of the most most of
so , what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are born .
so the big question is , `` what are smart , are smart , right ? ''
because if we could find that , we would have never been able to have a lasting human impact .
so many people we have in the world at least one hour per day with the worse time .
these are our job . 500 million people that are most good in `` something '' .
and the next decade we have another billion players that are extraordinary well in which they 're always working .
if you have n't heard it yet .
the game developed system that we 're working on for a long-term time is to work with the energy and for a month , instead of the coffee system , with the players at the whole world
you 'd expect to have a million billion player in the next
and we have now in a hundred billion players .
so i started to think , what it is to make us make these games ?
here 's the four things i 've found . this is : josh .
okay , so imagine that as an enormous age .
now , what 's marketing is to say , immediately , to do something to do a task , together with the faith that we have a social hope .
and so players are always trying to make a nuclear device , and it always is being used to try and try it , and it 's just going
bad player , right .
players are masters of the lower times of social skin .
there 's a lot of interesting research that show you that we 're all more like to have with them if they 're buying us successful grades .
the reason for that is that there 's a lot of trust to play a game with someone .
we 're saying that one time we spend with us that the rules will be created , that we have the same goal and keep on the edge of the road .
so , the conversation allows the growing to grow through the animal , trust ,
as a result of these we build a lot of social relationships
forty solar energy . fantastic !
you know , there 's one reason why the ancient history of the ancient 40 hours of 10 hours just to take you as an
the reason is that , if we play , we actually be very happy to work hard than if we 're not hungry or anything .
we know that we work as human beings , if we make sure we make sure we make hard work .
and the players always are willing to work hard if they get the right task .
and finally , some meaning of meaning .
bad player love to be part of this little , ancient , active , of
here 's a toy to put this into the right light , and you know all the wikipedia , the biggest one of the world .
the second largest thing in the world , with nearly lower meters , is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information about the world of warcraft on the internet than any other aspect of any of the world 's world today .
they create a massive story .
they create a strong force of the knowledge of the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four main planes that lead to one single , players are an old , kind of , like ,
it 's people who believe they can change the world as a half of the world .
and the only problem is they believe , you can change the virtual worlds , but you ca n't .
that 's the problem i try to solve .
feynman 's an accident .
his work is amazing . he figured out why people do so much time , energy and money in afghanistan .
and he says , `` we 're going to spend out of no less than a nuclear world sentence in virtual worlds and
and that 's when it 's from a heart word . so ,
and he 's saying , ``
not like i 'm , i guess games , i 'm something like a little bit
so he says that it 's actually going to get sense of the things that the players can actually get in the real
you can use social use as well in the real life , and you get more and you can play in games as the real life .
so , he says , it 's completely impossible that the players are getting more time to the virtual world in the real days .
i just have to do this for a voice .
but it 's definitely not an accident .
we have to start to turn the real world in a game .
my inspiration comes from one event that i 've been working for about the
there is these ancient apps , made of coffee , right ? you know
this fantastic decade was made a crash .
and these were the first of people developed .
and if you know about the very old , ancient thing that you may see this story , you may be going to be this story , and , you know , the
and i was very much like to be a lot of the way that we had a little
and if there was such a big divergence that the king had come to an crazy idea .
people were scared . people were fighting .
it was a huge situation . it was needed to create a massive solution
and so they invented , they were in love , `` well , '' the job and the captain 's national strategy . in a day they would eat . the
and they would be able to be able to be able to be able to get into the airplane , because games is so fascinating and so with wood , an amazing public community , that they would forget
and then the next day you would play , and the next day you 'll eat .
and most of the most famous people they took up this incredible one for 18 years , she had to stop a day and then
in the same way , i think we 're playing games .
we 're playing games to give the benefits of the real world .
we 're playing games to get to it , to avoid everything in the real world , that the world is not very glamorous , and we 're going to give us playing out of the game .
but that does n't have to be the end .
that 's the theme of the topic
and i would n't better , according to 18 years of the world 's famous , i started to the king , an
they put the model of two girls .
they played a keyboard , and the voice had to go to a partner , and
they went on board and they did looking for a new home . they just had so many people back to how they had food and worked with the rest of a place where they could grow .
it sounds crazy , right ?
but to medical , robert darwin show that the crash , the way the most famous rich is the most powerful , the same animal as the
and so scientists recently came to realize that `` well , '' `` that '' `` god
and then they found out that a global survey that almost been on the most 20 years to get the most famous
so this could be familiar .
maybe you have actually got people in playing with play , by playing 18 years of time in games , and then those of these tools have learned , and so much about the other experience that they have been able to have the whole
so , we can do that .
we 've been doing in the early department
this was the first chapter in real real world 's world of the world 's world 's world . this
they had been published for 18 years , we 've been in 16 years .
i 'll argue , we 're ready for our own desires .
so , they sent half of their jobs on a new world , and so i 'm going to take my 21 billion watts a week .
we should be to the extent that half of us spend an hour of a few 10 , until we have the problems of the real world .
i know you 're asking to say , `` how do we solve the real world in games ? '' and exactly that question i have the question of doing my work in the last few years of the future
we have this cancer in our office in michigan magazine , and it 's called the future for how we should understand the
we do n't want to try to say the future of the future
what we want to do is the future .
we want to introduce the best of the best stories , and then people can get to the best , this idea of
we 're looking for an extraordinary notes , and we 're going to give people to reach them
i 'm going to show you a few words that i 've designed to try to try to help people of the most profound expression of their own future
this is `` world without oil . ''
the game is in 2007 .
it 's a game game system that you have to go to get a loan
the irony is invented , but we have enough , so it 's going to be used for them and they 're going to have the real life of oil , which is what are the most of the oil that they 're doing , how the world 's
we did this game with a professional arm in 2007 , and we 've been hearing it since the last three years .
and i can tell you it was a really figure experience .
nobody wants to change their lives , because it 's good for the environment or because we should .
but if you are in a more old age , and you 're going to be the oil .
this is an amazing adventure , where you go .
find out how to survive , most of our games have put in the game game .
so we 're playing for the next few minutes , and more more , more more like a disaster version as
we have the game `` jeopardy '' in the center for the future .
now , the only thing of a surgery is that people only have about eight years to the planet .
this dish is called the global canyon gallery , of course .
the call to the player , to the players , have more than a `` an `` jeopardy '' ] than
you know , you know , you know , `` the way that 's going to be a nuclear speaker , you 've got the boat , the scientists , the most and you
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say , everybody is in the class , and it 's our job , the future for energy , food , security , security , and the future of social justice .
and several players playing the game eight weeks .
they found 500 times of creative solutions that they can read when they were `` jeopardy . ''
and the last game we 'll get to the three : square one , which is a game game in collaboration with the world
if you put this game , it will be the world 's force called social fuels , then 2010 .
we 're working with medical school in a lot of europe , and i have a set of social
we have a paper program . we 've got `` cool '' ] high . '' we have a sense of `` real '' for advertising
i 'd like to share all the time with young people everywhere around the world , especially in the classroom that are possible to save their own social designs in the world .
i 'll come to the end now .
i want to ask a little questions .
what do you think when the next thing is next ?
we have the very fantastic player , we have games that show us what we can do , but we have n't yet been n't getting the real world .
well , i hope you 'd agree to me that bad human resources can be able to help us in real real lives that we can make the real life and that games have a huge meaning for change
we 've all been in the same way to try to use the capacity of social networks , the ability to make a sense of social waste ,
i really hope we play a lot of puzzles in the planet to survive a more century in this planet .
and i hope you 'll design it with me these games .
if i 'm going to go to the next 10 years , i 'm sure in two of two ways : that we can create any more amazing future , and that we can
so i say , `` well , let 's start next games
thank you .
i would like to tell you a little bit about what i 'm going to do a few months ago i 'd like to write
i always have been writing , i used to do my own career research , but i was working with the work of the subject , and i was looking at that , and i never had no idea in my life , which is that
i 'll read you the one guy .
`` stage , '' as `` as a `` '' '' `` well , '' as `` as a `` '' '' `` `` well , '' as `` play , '' `` oops , '' you have a drink , a designer , a designer , a psychologist , a psychologist , a psychologist , a psychologist , a lot of water , a lot of
tr : healthy , strong , more . ''
i 've been reading this list a friend of love and had a job , and it was almost so much , but i was only going to go to my point and i was n't going to be a writer and to read myself and the stories of this session
of course , that was a miracle old minister . i thought i 'd just thought that the letters has to be a little old .
but in fact , a computer video in the early '90s when i started working with school school and started to build my way outside my family 's art and then i could find it in terms of other children and the rest world around me .
and god thank you that i did n't use a campaign .
if i was to take a seriously seriously , i would be a little bit positive at one world , and someone would be able to be a person in a way that would be a sense of hard , but today , i 'm going to go to the opportunity
so i immediately immediately been able to go and immediately i was going to go to visit the crash department of 2009 and
