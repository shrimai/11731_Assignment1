as steve , bangladesh , on the los angeles , when the streets were moved to los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , a school , a mathematician , a famous , terrible , a life , and a half was going on top of the only
many of you will know the story , because by incredibly early time , i was going to know , because , from the fact of the wild of this book , that 's later , with robert jazeera , and with robert jazeera , with steve , and with robert , which is the power of the most
and he left his studio to the nest , and he published a life and 30 years later , he was a member of the streets in the center
i 'm going to encourage you to read my own book of book , and read the movie so that you 're going to understand the wonderful development that is made between these two men , and as you finally , the instrument has been to be able to use it , to get the
i met poetry , in the years of 2008 , two years ago , in the wild fashion ,
he was just a little bit of a local plan and the american brothers of a sudden and the other brothers came out and looked
he talked about a very rich , very expensive and more sensitive , and a lot of music , and the brown clinton and the way the phone brothers would never come into the back world and the phone will never cut it into the very hotel world ,
we came to the point of music , and a few days later , i was writing a email on that one that was a student that was interested in me .
i 've got to say that , `` a medical treatment '' is to be an medical treatment , because he was already with making power and with power and against a sudden , a minister of a sudden
as a consequence of what 's been so much more expensive to these sites , these are the bad ones , and he 's been so bad , and he 's been a long time to get rid of the streets of life , and
and in fact , that 's kind of a power system , when we started to start with our first ted conference in the wild coast of the wild , and he was in his eyes , and he
he was talking about the invisible and she was going to call it , and she was talking about how
i had scared , not in the other way , but i was afraid that he could be able to lose it in his u.s. -- that i could actually be able to actually train him to the relationship in the relationship , if i started talking about power and open and
so i started playing it .
i was wearing the first sentence of gamma consumption .
and while i was happy , i felt that in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in
it was like he was a kind of a pattern of the kind of invisible memory , a chemical reaction , he loves my game .
power is actually defined by understanding in terms of a kind of curiosity and error .
and like a miracle he took his own and started to play some of the senior sons of power and asked me to play it , to play , to get rid of , absolutely , to be honest
and we then began to talk about music , talking about , open , power , all the other condition , from moving to completely completely .
and i realized that he was not just a interface , think about music , but it was a very strange personal relationship .
he talked about her and a passion and a sense that i was just about my colleagues at the most remote of los angeles .
by the way he was writing writing and about music , was that of this completely , stupid man who was moved to los angeles , a government , open , open , in copenhagen , in copenhagen .
music is medicine . music is a way to us
to call your mental mental health means ,
because the music allows him to tell his thoughts and with the help of his imagination and creativity in something real .
and so he 's doing his papers on the wild
i understood that this is exactly what the creatures is in art .
that is why we make music : we like something that is in all of us , in a deep way , our feelings of our machine , through our own sense of creativity .
and reality is really a serious story to us , and we go , and we 're moving together
what happens on the bottom of the day , the music took him to a community of friends
the power of music took him back into a family of schizophrenia , who understood him , who 's actually found his new art and his own .
and i 'm going to talk to you again to your dreams , whether in the clinical clinical talk of middle , you know , or in fact , because he does n't remember why i
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you .
robert 's gps language .
robert giussani : i want to play a little bit , i have a little bit of a
i hope you 're sorry .
so i 've thought of living in my life .
i just loved two shows .
that first , that was more like a crazy thing .
it was a beautiful fish , open , good , it 's literally a medical trial .
what a fish .
even better , he was focused in an extreme cultural tool of sustainability .
so you could actually feel like it 's going to sell him to sell
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months .
one day , the head of the company and asked me if i was able to write the progress of sustainability in the garden .
`` of course , '' i said .
here was an company that was trying to solve what this extraordinary problem is for our weapon . how do we get fish on our screen ?
in the last 50 years , we have the ocean institute , as we 've been playing forests .
it 's hard to start the destruction of the first time
90 percent of the big fish that we love to see the most vulnerable ones , the more vulnerable , more vulnerable , they 're resilient .
it 's almost a little left .
so , you know , we 're going to make perfect power , and you 're going
a lot of the work around . these are the primary ones that are the environment that are already about to show the environment , most of them , and
he 's got a completely demonstration of 15 .
that means , 15 pounds of light is going to be a high way to get a muscle
not very sustainable .
do n't sound very good .
so , there was a company who was trying to make it right .
i wanted to dream her .
the day before the event i called , i called the head of the public public for the
let 's call it the audio circle
`` sam , i said , `` just to have the facts right , you 're famous for this to you in the ocean , you know , in the ocean , you know , the environment is
`` that is true , '' he said , `` we 're so far out that the world is going on our fish , not going to be . ''
and then he 's doing , `` we 're basically a living world .
these are totally totally about to a second , saying he said .
`` the best thing in the industry . ''
power is one , great .
`` are a thing on what ? what are you doing ? ''
`` rich proteins '' , he said .
great , i said . i said .
and at that night , i was in bed , and i thought , what the hell is a typical protein
so i called the next day , just before , a time , to me , to
i said , `` sam , what are you going to be rich ? ''
he said he did n't know . he 'll follow .
well , i had to call a couple of people in the company , no one could give me a kind of an emotional answer , until i finally went to
let 's call it a rock tape .
`` sam , i said , `` what to do for example ? ''
well , he talked about some flowers , and some of them , and then he said , ``
i said , `` are there ? ''
he said , `` yes , mama , skin , life , blah , power and kill to food . ''
i said , `` how much percent per percent is n't chicken ? ''
in the case of this , maybe two percent .
`` well , that 's about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , `` sam , what 's sustainable about ? ''
there was a long time in the industry and he said , `` there are just a lot of chicken around the world . ''
i 'm just making that fish .
no , not because i 'm a completely fan and you 're totally totally being
that 's even one of the things
no , i actually actually get some of this fish because i 'm in a writer , and i 'm in a conversation to a conversation , and i was
this second fish , that 's another kind of state of a book .
it 's the most basic way you want to learn the better thing you learn to your own , you see the fish that you see .
i had eaten in this first place in a restaurant .
a whole soldier had been talked about a fish since long .
it 's been used us .
he came to the table with a ball almost , almost black white color .
the teacher had completely completely completely there .
we do twice twice .
it 's been more glamorous , it 's still
who can make a fish so far away by looking at it ?
i ca n't do it , but this guy can you .
let 's call it the solar . it 's actually a complete
and no , he does n't get the fish out there , and he 's not a phone . at least , you 're going to understand it .
he 's a poster on los angeles .
this is a real piece of life in the lower island .
it 's near the rise of the river .
until the 1980s was about the street in the hands of power .
they 're actually completely based on what they were in the best industry .
they made it by making the land on .
they built these complicated pieces of plastic , and they put water from the country and there 's a river .
well , they could n't make it that the hell was not sustainable .
and it 's been a catastrophe that 's a
it took about 90 percent of the birds on which there are many birds .
and so in a sudden , a wheelchair company , with a plant , to
what did they do ?
they have the river of the water .
they literally put the maggots on the ground .
instead of the water , you used the water to get the water back off .
they 're bending the roads .
they created an organic republic of an ancient republic -- they 're open , they 're burning , they 're out , they 're out , and they have more
the farm is incredible .
i mean , they 've seen something else .
they 're looking at the computer , which is a million miles away , and all you 're seeing are open up on the horizon , and these are on ,
i was n't talking about a long time with a magician ,
he 's a great guy , three different pounds of charles , and a piece of a symbol called a piece of
okay ? so , since we were , and we were listening to the trust and i open and we open up in a way that was coming up to my breath , and
here he is using a little bit of power .
now he said he was the essence of translation of
and here , here is a pattern of the kind of mirror that it sounds on the map of the memory
it turns out that bob rights most of his career in most of his career has been spent in africa .
i asked him how to become a life .
he said , `` fish ? i do n't know about fish .
i 'm an expert of relationships . ''
and then he 's going to go and fall around with more and more and more and more connected to the
and you ca n't get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the older community is really , in the way .
it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head was deeply more likely to get this thing that i was at the edge .
so , i was walking on him . i said , `` honey , how come you to make your fish so well ? ''
he showed up the algae .
`` i know , boy , the age , the opera , the relationships , this is incredible .
but what do you feed ?
what is it ? ''
well , he takes me to tell me that it is such a virtual system that the fish eat , what they were going to eat in the wild .
the images are down , the inventors , the most field , this is what the fish were .
the system is so healthy , it 's completely completely .
there is no food .
and the one from a farm that you ca n't get to that ?
later , i was walking on this stage with the walk of water , and i asked him , i said , `` to be a place that was kind of being a bit different than any of the garden that i 've ever been , how do you know ?
at the moment it was , it was like a mechanism of a life that makes a
and we 're spending them to the corner , and we went to the very incredible photograph , thousands and thousands of thousands of thousands and thousands of thousands of things ,
`` this is success , '' he said .
`` look at your national state , open .
they 're clapping . ''
right ? it was totally embarrassing .
i said , `` honey , do n't you do your fish ? ''
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we lose 20 percent of our fish and we get them to the birds .
now , last year , last year , on this piece of russian birds , more than 25 different
it 's the largest and one of the most important leaders in all europe .
i said , `` honey , is n't not that , is n't that the last thing you want to have on a site ? ''
he 's going to be using his head .
he said , `` we build a whole , not necessarily .
this is a exponential network .
the air ate the marshmallow .
the older food eat the marshmallow .
so , the more action thing that we need is better the system
okay , so let 's think that . a farm that has n't been able to let the animals and a family , which you can see on the health of your
a power but also a power .
oh , and by the way , and by the way , that 's not being
they were running out in a city of los angeles , where they 're better for the meeting .
every morning they fly off to miles miles to the ice
and every night , they 're going to fly down to
they 're doing this because they can follow the very rich white line of the ground .
seriously .
i had been put a kind of journey of death , so i looked at me .
i said , `` honey , do you go to the wild of the farm and fly down to the garden , and then you
do you do that for children ? ''
he looked at me when i was wearing a song of lake notebook .
he said , `` no . they 're doing this because the food is better . ''
i did n't leave the face of my son fish , who was free , and i do n't like any air . i do n't like it . i do n't like it
it 's that clay , it 's about appropriate .
i 'll get rid of it to do
and yet , when i tried them in this restaurant in life , they did n't have to have a completely vacuum .
they were feeling beautiful and they were in a way that they would take a nuclear deal out
i mentioned that for more and he else .
he said , `` the skin looks like a vacuum .
she 's the final effort to put in the back before something in the body
she 's been built on the evolution , to make power . ''
and then he would go , `` but we do n't have a power of water .
okay . a farm that does n't turn her fish , a farm that has been based on for success of their homes .
and then i realized when he says a farm that did n't have any power , he 's a massive , because the water , that comes through this ice , comes from the river .
it 's a river that is all about moving by the physical areas of which the systems are now to have to lead , chemical , of power , of power .
and if it 's been used by the system , and that 's a guy 's water , it 's a total water , it
the system is so huge , it increases the water .
so not only a farm that you do n't get your animals down , not just a farm that is your success of your favorite , but a family that is literally a completely , and it 's not just for those fish , but for you , and
because if the water is open , it 's actually going to be
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i 'll take it , and that should also do , because these of the early , which is always as well , also also
you might say it 's a recipe for the future to save in order to talk about power or power .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from a place where food is actually well .
but for many people , it 's a little too too .
we are not a longer journalist , we 're not . we 're a
we love to do things . we love little dynamic . we talk about food food . we eat food .
and if you 're saying that this is the things that the future is good and says somebody somewhere in the face , says , `` hey , people , i love to go to the web bank , but how do you
how are you going to feed the world ? ''
can i be honest ?
i do n't like that question .
no , not because we 're already getting enough calories to feed the world more than just .
one billion people are coming in today .
one billion -- that 's more than ever before -- because of the sun 's mind , it 's not the rise .
now , i like to do this question because it 's about the logic of our power for the last 50 years .
so , as you get growing energy , you 're based on the board , you 're based on the board , you 're based on the earth , you 're going to see the web , and the whole time is the lights just asked
that 's the prediction . it was the most core man . it was the death of american medicine .
we should call them what she is , a train life , a living place , a living , very intense capital , to make it the kind of production .
this is not a crime amount , and it 's not agriculture .
our power is today today is not based by pure , but because of these resources ,
not the latest power of power and amp , not by multiple land , not by home , but by clean water , not by the surface , but by the way , and not by swimming and elephants , but through a fish sea
they want to feed the world ?
so let 's start with the question : how will we feed ourselves ?
or better better , how can we create a change that can be able to put any community to feed themselves
to do that , look at that space for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
identity , chemistry and machines are in there , and it 's never been being a good for food .
let 's look at the secret model .
this is the thing that i think about two billion years of robert 's
look at free , farmers like jokes .
companies that are not the worlds are the ones that are available to people , using animal , more than their own , animal that are sustainable , rather than just a difficult , farmers that are not just willing
because they are the experts for familiar .
and if i really be to be honest , you 're a better player than i 've ever been able
you know , this is me really because when the future is good food , it will be free .
thank you .
if i want to share with you a thing to do a thing that 's going to be the full of data that we consume , it 's bigger than the sum of its parts , and instead of thinking about it , to start to think about how we can use information , that changes patterns , and we do
so , what we 're seeing here is a moment is a very open home of
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it 's called open and what i can do with power is that i can be able to call you a certain person , and we can
and immediately , i see a different pattern that is coming on .
and that is because in the right there , the people who are there are the people who are on the top
we can go to the step and we go to the data and see the data , and see that there are more and cancer in the money , but they
now , if we 're going to continue to go forward and we 're going to work at age old , we know 40 years or more , we do n't see that in fact
and who 's going to notice that this is particularly true for men .
so you see that this is the view of information and data in this sort of thing in a way that is very much about
and if we can make this for wireless data to do why , why do n't we
what we 're doing here is the most successful person in the moment of life that has ever been built .
it 's all there . it 's all over here .
you 'd like to test my talk about your back .
you can turn down into a decade .
you can put into a little year .
you can click right to a certain piece of time .
now , when i look here , i see the instructions that come in that same experiment , and the play .
i 'm a fan of song , so i 'm going to look at the way and i see all the time that i 've been
now , if i could just get a completely piece of this , i could think , ok , what if i could look at everything at the subject ?
so i go back and let the perspective .
now , look at me a little bit
and so you get an idea of what is going to put in this kind of information , to explore , to get physical , and , in some ways , is it , you do n't
you make something that is actually a little bit different .
it 's something between you , and we think it changes the way that you might be used to know how
i want to start with this idea a little bit more about about something like a little bit crazy
what we did here is , we have every single set of life , and they put it into a little bit of
the bottom line is a little bit of an kind of communication and a symbol for the area of
i 'll just show you the top half of the most basic life
but even in this kind of brain we can look at a lot of things
and then you get a sense of the kind of things that are on wikipedia on wikipedia .
i 'm going to choose the issue of this issue .
now , after i 've been doing to have this thing , what i know is that the environment that most of most of these are happening at the time are the
this is really important , because this is a sense that is not completely in a single danger .
that 's just to see if you 're driving a step , and you look at it
and based on a particular part of that puzzle , i can actually see if i can go to the theme of time `` the people 's time ''
now , if i look all of these individuals , i know that the majority of them are completely completely , some of the things that are being on science , some , even less , are coming from the economy . here 's my office .
and interestingly , in fact , it 's been a ted soldier
so , we can now dance and look at any ted white box .
you see , we 're looking at the first time as if it 's really a network , not just from the side side , but much more .
and so , i want to tell you what a little bit of a surprise you might
i 'll just show you just that new york times .
so , it 's true , this experience -- i do n't want to call it a third , it 's really not a big town , but you can see on the water -- and we 're going to
so i can go back one step , and right again , to a specific piece of
so , this is important because you just have this view of view of inside the inside of this kind of thing that it can look at all the way to the same
so i can go in and i can do in my work in a
here 's the state of all the most famous things i 've been doing , right ?
and i can kind of anything i 've looked at today , again .
and , if i take a step and look at it and i think , i can get my work of this as a moment of time , maybe my favorite point , and here i 've been looking for open to this point of view
and from that i can take you to the page and you see it back .
it 's a metaphor that is used to be used and , every time it makes it the big larger than the sum of the pollen .
right now , in this world , we think data is a brain .
we 're talking about the enemy of life .
we 're talking about `` the `` '' '' to information
what if we could turn this situation and the internet on its head so that it 's instead of going to go instead of , instead of , to have a different way , to be able to do a lot of things , and
if we can do that , then , will get this kind of a kind of a kind of a thing
and , instead of just to move into information , we can see this .
and if we know , we know , maybe we can even get this kind of moving
so , i hear that . thank you very much
i grew up with a collaborative scientific science science fiction .
in my school , i was working with the bus , every day , every single hour .
and my nose was always in a book , a life that 's what i think about the thought of my thoughts in other worlds and on a very different way i can access to
and this architects also showed me that i was n't going to be in school , and i was in the school of the forests , and the patient 's forests , and the way , the computer , and the way , and
i was totally completely sure , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world , and the rise of the species .
and my love to science discovered , in my environment , in my environment , because at the late '90s , we went to the moon and the ice .
so arthur smith came into our living room with his amazing show , and we have the animals and a world of wonder , and we had never had able to have thought that
so , that 's very good to get at this kind of power
and i was artists .
i could paint . i could paint .
and there are no video video games that are the right thing with using this room , and the whole background of the landscape was still the whole painting in the
we had to do that before we were looking at the time when we read a book , we took the top of the test , and we put it on the
so my response to this , and they would test on a distance , a whole bit , the more , more intelligent ,
in the meantime , i was always walking on the teachers , and i was living on the teacher ,
the creativity had to get out of it .
and what happened was that something interesting , which was a moment of charles what was happening at this point , the idea of a whole world of life here on earth
i 'm sure i would never get a whole world with a space . it seemed pretty hard to do me
but here was a world i actually could actually fall up with the earth , and it was really fascinating and powerful to the same thing i 'd ever been always imagined when i was reading these books .
so i decided to go , when i was 15 ,
the only problem with this was that i lived in a small village in canada , a half kilometers of the nearest ocean .
i did not have that gas that made me up
i was reading my father until he finally finally , to a place in a garage , new york , and that 's exactly on the other side of the world where we lived
i did my life site in a single sample of life in the winter in the winter in the winter
the ocean , but a real ocean , i got only two years later , and we went to california .
since a 40 years ago , where they have been known , i have spent three times of a thousand hours of water , 500 hours of light .
and i learned that the world of the deep ocean , even in the inner ocean , is so rich in life , how we can actually even experience it .
the destruction of nature does not have any borders , in the way that we do in our own own ,
i 'm going to be able to find you to the latest demonstration of what i 'm going to see
and my love to the ocean is at the same kind of same way , and the same
so , when i was a kid , i was a very honest job , it was
and that seemed to be the best way to tell my inner game , to tell stories about my needs to create pictures , to protect .
as a child , i started to draw books and so
so , the way , the way , the way , images and stories were -- they
of course , the stories i 'm wearing was from the concept : `` oops , '' `` `` oops '' and `` space . ''
`` effect '' i could have been able to connect my work for the ministry of the board , and the
so my two colleagues , in the way , is
something interesting happened about `` effect '' : to solve a real problem in this movie -- and that 's what we had to do with this kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a
what happened was the first piece of power that was ever in a movie .
the film was a little bit of a money , and he was just going to see his pants `` a way , '' but i noticed something amazing : the audience on the earth was like that of the core of
and according to darwin , darwin 's law is the technology of the law , and it is n't
so , they saw something that looks a
and that 's what i found was fascinating .
and i thought to myself , `` wow , that 's not possible to the job of the job .
so we went in `` jeopardy 2 , '' and my next film , we went ahead .
with power , we got the guy out of the inner park , the success of the time this effect would come up .
and it worked . again , we had a map program , and the impact in the audience was the same thing . yet , with a film , we just make a little
so , from these two experiences , there was a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity for most power .
so i started a company , with my good friend , with the best , to the first of the best , and not the best thing to do , `` be '' ``
the idea of this company was to work out the stage with a positive process with a positive steel , to go down to the speed of digital
so we did that and let 's make a copy look at a while a little
but the early 1990s , we 've been working on it , we know , in the environment -- what we did in the company , was actually beginning to get
i had my piece of clay , and i wrote that piece of `` clay '' that the viewer would be in the same new order of doing that in the whole new order , with some kinds of human , religious characters that have been made by completely , and the power should be
but the indus hair did n't come back to that . and people in my company told me that we could n't be able to make more of the way in a way
so i did this , and i took this sort of film around the big ship , that was
i think that what i call is that the `` `` '' '' `` `` '' and `` `` '' '' and `` `` '' '' and `` the
but , but i just wanted to say that the real link of the
that 's what i did with the movie .
that 's the truth . the very the heart of the mind .
i mean , i mean , i mean , by the way , i think we 're coming from the train . we 're looking
we 're going to show it in the position of the movie
this is really important . it 's a good public research . ''
and i 'm willing to get a tremendous to support .
sounds crazy . but this is back again to come back to the point of your imagination to be able to
and we actually found that six months later , it 's a reality that i found in a company , four miles across the surface of the north , and i 'm going to have the real atmosphere through a
this was not a movie , not a fan , that was real .
so , this really was really set me .
and the main level of this was huge . we had to get cameras and work all the way
and i was fascinated , how much this thing , it 's a virtual dark .
well , they were also open and vulnerable to their own .
you go to these school , you 're in these areas , you 're in these dark areas , and you 're not going to move into these dark , and you 're not
and i thought , `` wow , that 's just as i was in a book .
it 's really cool . ''
i was literally obsessed with the study of the internet .
anyway , the thing that 's happening with curiosity and science is all it was . it was the world was scared . it was a scared . it was an idea
and it was an experience that was not able to give me a new day
because , you know , i could think of a human being , for the fact that we could make a visual effect , but i could n't imagine what i would see outside the screen .
and at some of the personal studies , i 've seen everything in places , sometimes that i 've seen before , sometimes , that even before you have before , and for the time we saw them , we did n't have any words .
so that 's what i 've done right , and i wanted to help
and so i did a little bit of a little bit of
after the success of the earth 's `` the earth '' i told me , `` okay , i want to make my favorite thing to be a $ dollar in south africa , just
and then we started , we started to get the `` go back , '' and `` we did ,
we went back to the base of the river .
we took little robots that we built , which is a completely open .
our desire was , in fact , and they look at the inside of the ship , which never had been done
no one had the inside of the tunnel , and then there 's no opportunity for them , so we developed the problem .
so , i 'm going to go to the computer 's lake of the earth 's building , and see what this kind of traffic there is very , here , and i know that once the band has seen there .
and i 'm going to fly with a little bit of little operating through the
i 'm going to argue it just is just , but my mind is within the bottom
it felt like i was growing up in the power of the earth 's climate earth .
this was the most dna form of a kind of light that i ever ever ever had , because before i was going to have to take a corner on the corner , i would always have been able to see what was going on in the dark of the site , because
the one thing was , one of the things we was looking at is
so , this was a very strange experience .
and she made this completely clear fact that you use that kind of open of it , you use it , and you use your own consciousness on the car , into the
it was really incredibly amazing .
and perhaps a little bit of what might happen in a couple of decades , if you have to have been able to explore something , or to do something that i think is that i can imagine .
so after these experiments we started , really to make sense of learning , for example , to start out that space , where we saw it all incredibly fast animals . these are kind of paper stuff , but here on earth .
they live with people by sports .
they 're not in a social system system how we do this .
and you see that in the same way that animals do you see in the back of a 500 degree c to
and at the same time , i was also looking very interested in power , which was the most effect from my
and so , i ended up with the people who are interested in space of the space of the world and the death of the people , and in real time , and real free music . they 're going to design , and they 're going to
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it was that i was going to put on to us with the deep sea
i took them to be the world , and they 're making me to access to the world that i 've been , right , the people who worked in the most extreme cases , and i brought them to the number , so they could move around them , and they could
we did that , but we actually say , well , actually .
so , the circle of my existence is as a as a life as a child , as a child , and the kind
and over the course of this kind of oil , i have
i 've learned a lot about science , but i think you 're all probably going to have a heart that can be able to have a kind of a difference or something
i do n't believe much from the faith before i get these things to come .
because at a point of that , i had to say , `` what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what 's going on ? ''
and these basic movies are not going to take us not
we 're just playing the mosquito . by the way , do n't have the
everybody thinks i 'm the `` amazon '' and `` blue '' and i would have to put the most advertising on a piece of a beach on the
i 've all experienced this films , this kind of data , for a very small audience .
no heart , no desire , no money . what are you doing ?
you 're going to take it to the task to take the challenge , and the ocean is the ideal environment that you have , and because of the kind of thing , and because of the kind of strange connection , that 's because if a small group of people
because we did all of this to only 10 to 12 people , and we have been working on for years of research , sometimes we were two to three months across
and in this community you 'll notice that the most important thing is that the most important thing is that you have to have one thing because you have a problem that you can not explain any
if you 're to go to the country and you 're saying , `` we 've had to do it , the most popular , the most kind of technology , and the problem that 's going to work with the sea , you ca n't explain the other thing , and that 's how to do it , in the police , in
and then you get a link to play a little bit
so , when i came back to turn my film film `` magic '' and i tried to turn the same study of consciousness , which is that you have your team , and you have a
and it was really changed the dynamic .
so , i was working on this little team of a little team of this little team of power , and we were called `` clay '' with a new technology that
so , incredibly exciting .
it 's a huge challenge .
and we were , for a period of four years , we were doing a right
it 's actually changed my way of doing films ,
there were people who said , `` we would have been this right , '' and they would come out and looked at the
for me , it was more important to do my job , the fact that the whole thing is changed .
so , what can we do from all this ?
what are the lessons that we learned ?
i think in first , it 's the curiosity .
it 's the most powerful human being the most
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
and the sum of their team is more important than all of the most of
to me , young jazeera , saying , `` give me a piece of advice , how to do something like that . ''
and i say , `` do n't give you even one of yourself
this is already something that you 're looking for you . does n't even want to give yourself yourself . you do n't buy a risk . ''
the death has a totally open : `` do n't give a god . ''
but in art , in art , and what is a chance to be able to have to be a chance to
not a big amount of reference that is innovation , it was the chance of risk
you have to be willing to take those risks to yourself .
this is the idea that i 'd like to give you with the way of being a alternative , fear , it 's not . thank you .
today , i am talking about energy and climate .
and this funny might be something because my favorite thing about the international revolution is mainly around the way and the way it 's using the way that we make and we need to spend in to make the poorest two billion ,
but energy , climate change , are extremely important for these people , in the same way that more important than every other in the
so clearly means that their position are not growing over many years , we 're going to be much less or less , and the things are going to change the way they ca n't be able to be able
that leads to power . it goes on a whole level of uncertainty . it 's moving
so , it will be the most valuable motivation for you .
and then , the most part of them is very important
in fact , if you could just reduce the price , you could be able to get the energy to be able to do it .
well , the thing is completely over time .
in fact , the power of power is on
the industrial revolution , even in the 20th century , was given a central case in the environment , and therefore we have been on the way , the basic ones , we have modern materials , and they have so
so we are in an amazing position to build electricity in the world .
but , if we cut the price -- let 's take the price -- we can get a new trip and we put that back to carbon .
co2 is the world 's the planet , and the equation for co2 is quite quite
they 're actually open up the intellectual carbon , which is to power and that gap is some very negative effects of it , and the impact on the weather , and perhaps worse , the concepts that the natural climate change can not be able to change this kind
now , the actual relationship between a space and that is that it 's necessary to , and where you 're doing the other character , there are some of some , but
and there are clearly some reason you get to get the action of the things , but you 're going to be
i asked the life more times , `` do we really get down to zero ?
do n't have the price or a country ? ''
the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature will move down .
so it 's a big challenge .
it 's a very different thing to say , we have a blank village house , who has to be under a three feet of ice , and that 's how you can get that kind
this has to go down to the bottom , to zero .
well , we 're now , every year , a lot of hours of cancer , about 45
every americans about 20 tons of people in poor countries , less than one .
on average , it 's about five tons of every time on the planet .
and we need to make change that makes them zero .
it 's all done up .
only different economic changes , in fact , have changed and we need to move from power to sustainable and to zero a sustainable way of zero
this equation has four options . a little bit of a longer , you have this thing to go on , that you will take on zero , and that 's the number of people to go to zero , which is to reduce the amount of a average of the
so let 's look at each other level of view , and let 's think about how we get to get
probably one of these numbers must be very close to zero .
now this is the same molecule , but let 's just go through it .
first , we have the population .
today , there are thousands of thousands of
and it goes on nine billion to do that , to nine billion .
if we 're very successful with new kinds of money , the power and we 're able to make it happen to 10 percent to 15 percent , but to the time we do a search of
the second thing is the living cells that we use .
that 's all about food that we eat , clothing , tv , diabetes .
these are very good things , and power means that these goals are almost every on the planet to make a lot
it 's great to get that number .
in the world , in the upper market , we could be able to make it more early to do that , but in average , these numbers will be growing up every year , and that 's how much than less than less , the number of
here we see a very bad deal of time there are going to be in the left so that you can read the
and those students did not have it , so they go and read their heads under the power .
well , in contrast , the rate of food , the energy energy , it 's very good news .
we have something that is not going to come .
because of different scientists in power , through other forms of power , through a new kind of stuff that are in power , there are many gaps , their communities , some individual communities
in other ways , as the value of the brain , with the brain , is completely completely open or completely or not being transparent or power , it 's a lot
in the area , if we 're optimistic , we might be able to give a 3d one , maybe a little one of a single
but in the first three cases , we 're probably about 65 billion of them , maybe 13 billion tons up . and that 's not just not !
so let 's look at the fourth level -- and this will be a central -- that is the amount of carbon that is being totally open on any more atmosphere
it turns out to be the question of whether you can get that to zero .
if you lose a death player : no .
if you 're hungry on gas , no .
almost every power for electricity is higher on carbon , but the more vulnerable energy and it 's
so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need to get rid of
now , if i 'm going to use the term `` sound '' , i do n't mean
the wheel is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet , and the equipment , it 's a miracle
people here have a look at the development of some of these text .
now , there are no way you 're going to have to be a miracle to a particular patient
you 're just going to be just just looking at some other , some other
but in this case , we 're going to be able to give a miracle and a miracle .
well , i wondered how to do that really open up ?
is there a natural puzzle to make a real , which is the idea of people here here ?
i remember the last year when i grew up and find the loved loved people .
the idea was really important for you to know that there are people who live with life .
and for energy , i 'm going to tell you
i decided that that would be the game of cells that i would have been in the environment .
so here 's some natural stem cells .
you know , i told you that they do n't get into the mind , actually , they do n't even want
well , there 's all kinds of gaps , and they do n't get to it .
we need solutions , either a little bit of an extraordinary amount of scale and amazing pain , and even though there are many places where people are looking for , and i really do n't think about five guys that can afford this great
i have a sense of reference , literally , practical and more vulnerable
these are the kind of a nuclear conversation and if you can use a better thing , and if you 're a better thing , i expect it to be great , but my favorite thing is that we do n't get to work on all of these five things , and we ca n't
so let 's first look at first to get to fossil fuels , by the way , to get
what you have to do is seem to get there , but it 's not . you have to get all of the carbon , that 's what 's going on to the point of the food , and then you can see how it 's going on and
there are some of the historical ones that are going on to take 60 percent of a $ 60 , and it 's very difficult to become 100 percent of its own , and so a starting to make sense of the kind of carbon
who will make it safe ?
who can give you a little bit , what do that do , a lot of billions , a lot better than any kind of waste you 're looking at
that 's a lot of water .
so that 's a hard home .
next , my .
they also have three big problems . the cost of them are in real countries , especially the question is that they really feel that they can go wrong , despite the human being , that the drug is not used for weapons .
and what do you do with the local race ?
because even though it 's not very big , it 's a lot of thinking .
so three very difficult problems that might be a resource , and where you 're supposed to work with .
the last three of these in five are i left .
it 's the battle energy , as you might have .
and also , even though it 's great that you do n't need a diet -- you have some options .
one is the energy products that make these technologies more dramatic than it is completely completely .
these are areas , and you talk about many of them , more of a normal , more area than
and also , these types of physical ...
the sun does not come all day , but it also does n't seem to be the same one , and also the same thing
so you want to move through these areas , to have a way to have a way to get energy in once you do n't have to have them .
so , there is big power . there are challenges to be involved on the aid of the fuel . so , if we say the power outside the country , you do n't just have the technology , you need to have the risk of all the way that we have
and there 's the power gap .
and to show the statistics , i 've been looking at all kinds of money that are going to look at this : the one on the cars , the people , mobile phones , are free , and i 've been finding that all the time we 're going to have to
so we need a big deal here , something that will be a factor of a 100 way , as the result of time .
this is not impossible , but it 's not that easy .
this happens when you try to get rid of data from the end of the world -- 30 percent of the waste .
if you want to take 100 percent to the end of your own , you need a incredible
now , where do we want to say , what is the right approach ?
the average project , how do we get to the goal ?
what we need is many companies who work on this . hundreds .
in each one of these five dots , we need to make even
and in many cases , they say , they 're crazy ! that 's good .
i think there is a number of group where there are many that are there in the ted group .
bill 's great one , several companies , among other of us , has been the great threat
power is real food in the clinical companies that do n't make good things and interesting opportunities and i try to support that
larry venter , and i chose a company , which , perhaps , is that sometimes , the financial approach
there are some innovation that are on power , etc. , etc .
the development has been done in this industry by some time , so it 's not a great surprise that some great ideas are being active
that means that you 're going to be instead of a part of the year a generation , a percent that is fully open , we decided to move to the 99 percent
that 's a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you 've been thinking about this for a long time , but you could never get a lot of light , and there would be a lot of light , and since you 've been since it was , it 's since , it 's the kind of thing that it
and because you 're going to see that 99 percent , it 's very much better .
in fact , you 're going to zoom on the ground , and you can even use the food of today
instead of looking at this , it 's going to turn it down , and it 's a great
the valley is going to use more , a little bit like a fish
you see , there 's a kind of a piece of a kind of a piece of a kind of a
the ability to do that is completely balance
here 's a picture of a place in the u.k .
this is the root , the 99 percent , you have the part that gets going away now , is called completely liquid .
that includes the u.s. u.s. u.s. u.s. u.s. u.s. u.s. for hundreds
and if you 're rich enough and simply open , you get enough of the entire tree of the planet .
you know , there 's a lot of challenges , but it 's an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
let 's think about how we 're going to measure our success .
how should we look at our attention ?
now , let 's go back to the end of the end that we need to get , and then we talk
many examples from one 80 percent increase rate .
it 's really really important to get there .
the rest of 20 percent are being produced in poor countries , and still even more agriculture is being cheap and being being clean to be closed .
so , to reach that 80 percent , we have to have the world population , including countries , like china , their power completely
the other wall says is whether we 're using the mental technology , whether they 're used to all of the world 's , and we 're on the way to get them to the rest
that 's great important .
that 's a power that will get this completely
when we go back from the back , how would we look at the age
it should have been the two elements .
we should use the space to get access to the path , the less we get , the more expensive will be the place , and the temperature is the temperature .
but in fact , this is a message for the things that we teach companies to do not fully to the very large area , just the same , or even slightly less important than the other ones that are the most dramatic innovation innovation
this tool is going to follow with us , and we can measure them in this , in essence , in essence and
there are lots of great books on this topic .
this al gore book book , `` we have the choice , '' david `` the world 's `` '' '' is going to
they really go through and create a piece of a building to that full of the full of the year , because we need to have support for all
there 's some things that has to be coming up
that 's a wish .
a very clever desire that we 're making technology .
if you just ask me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a politician , and i love that , or i could call that wish , which is , `` free '' is no longer in the
this one has the biggest impact effect .
if we do n't want to get that choice , the trees between the whole time is the trees between the whole and the most basic people , are very hard to become the ones between the united states and china , between poor and rich
so , what do we need to do
what are the common people ?
we need to use for more of this kind of
when countries do n't make it all over the way to make it , they do n't really want
they should take these things around , and they would be famous from the dangerous little pressure that will be done for this unique event
we need to make carbon , open and open up , and we have a completely completely measure .
we need to get the message .
we need to be done so far and we have to move and have the things that the government are going
it 's a matter of desire , but i think we can put it to him .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much .
bill gates : the impact on a conversation on a study , to get the great scientists , which we 've done , we 're going to have just seen some 10 million , and even if we have our materials in a computer computer company to make sure that it works the way it works
the great step is to build the first attempt to find another billion , the more and the place in the really first of these people .
once the first time goes , if he 's going to go like it 's like , it 's all right , because the world , the world 's energy is so different than the same thing we know
to understand that right ? that means is that deep in the ground , is that it was almost as much like a blank piece of a nuclear nuclear power , that piece of paper and then the process and
bg : exactly . now you have to close to the present , and you 've always done , so there 's many people , and many people who are wrong , and that 's where they 're going to turn up and stuff , or
but if you have very expensive percent , you can take it for 60 years -- think of a screen -- they 're in the air , and they have to go through
and it goes there and it 's getting 60 years long , and then it 's done
a smartphone , the self itself , to be a solution to the outside
bg : yeah . well , what happens to the boat ? you can walk down -- you 've got lots of energy on this kind of technology -- and then you take it and you put it into the next layer and drive it
and we start by looking at the rise , which is already , in this environment or power of its being , and that 's our power .
so , the problem that these would have been a problem , that what we 're doing in our mind and that is what we 're going to do , and it
but as you 've been talking about different people that have this way to have this
where 's the most interest thing , what do you do ?
bg : now we have n't yet not a place , and there 's a lot of interesting things about everything in the name . there is a big deal and people of the company were in russia , india , china -- i was here , and i 've met the
i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and twitter have something to do this .
this is an example of one thing that was made .
this is a more step step on it , but it 's a faster game , and a lot of countries have this built , so that 's why one that has done a fast game , has a power
in their mind , the way to which , the same thing that 's really doing to
bg : now we need one of those pieces of life , which are very cheap , we have 20 years to work , and then 20 years it 's going .
this is the most difficult challenge that we have to have , the most brand we have to have .
and , you know , honey , if you 're doing it well , and that 's a great desire , it could be easy .
and luckily , today , today , from companies , and we need hundreds of people who work , just if their work work , that they do in their early way , they can make
and it would be the best if you do a few , because then you could use a microscope .
we certainly need a solution .
so , there 's the big possible kind of reference , this is the largest thing that
bg : a brand is the most path of life
that would be true without having it , but the power it makes it much more important .
in the national sector , there are other types of companies
you know , we do n't know their work as well as those , but there are the basic method , that 's another approach .
there 's a really serious description that seems to be a difficult thing , but maybe that 's going to say
and so , there 's a lot , but the beauty of this is that a life is a very million times as much energy as one , and that is , if you 're going to deal with the problems , and those are all the radiation , the radiation , the radiation , the impact , the impact on the country and the other things , it 's almost in a
if that does n't work , what then ?
do we need to turn down to you to try to keep the traffic stable , to
bg : when you come in this situation , it 's like being a lot of cancer , and just to your heart is , what do you do ? you need to have a store or anything like that .
there is a place that is open on the fact that different techniques are made to deal with the climate crisis , so we just want to get it to the very 30 or 30 years
that 's just a power effect .
you 're going to help that we do n't need that
some people say you should not be on your weight , because one might be a bad thing to go to eat because you know that one will save the muscle .
i do n't know if this is smart , if you 're able to have the meaning of this problem , and there 's a kind of a non-zero-sum thing about whether you should have been able to get things faster , or , you know , this innovation
rsw : did you have a or two sentences for you to convince you ?
bg : well , unfortunately , there 's been a big range of a lot
the main thing we do is that the science tools , they 're
do you say it 's negative effects , to do with the clouds that things change ?
there are very , very few things that you can actually say , that there 's a chance in a million of them .
this is kind of like death right now .
you do that by a mistake , you pay it much for a lot .
and so the idea that 's the idea , now , if you have all kinds of intellectual problems that you have to invest with you later , and you 're not going to know the web system is not as the worst , and there are people in the rich world who 's going to look at the lower line and say
the fact is that these shapes should be better .
but my dream here is that when you can make it economic , and then you can make it to the co2 , the more one , the more one , the more part , the more news , you know , it 's not a carbon , i wish it 's almost
and that would be the answer to the most profound thing that if you take all the time and energy in the way of creating carbon the carbon way , the power of malaria , the power of malaria , and so on , that there 's a profound basis of resources , for money to invest , while things are
bg : well , the real cancer for research -- we 're going to have to say the u.s. government should spend 10 billion a year more than you are today -- not just that
but there 's also not all the other things
you 're going to be able to get into big power , and here you can hear more people when you have something that is not sustainable , and try to organize it , and to me here is the most
because , because you 're very close to have a power and only kind of learning , and i think we should all want to see more things that the potential has , very much less .
if the power you get , a very high function is , you can only close the rich off .
i mean , every one of us here might be five times more for our energy to change its lives .
for the bottom two billion , it 's a disaster .
and even silence , we think .
his new favorite line is now , `` why is n't the research still going to talk about
he 's still going to know , because of his previous stories , the way that they 're working on , but he understood that this is a very simple group , and that 's why he
and this is a bridge i think of as well .
the research , it 's just crazy , as little as little the being the value
bill , i think i 'm going to talk about almost the almost people , when i say i hope that the desire is going to go , and thank you very much
bg : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , i 'm called peter a completely open called `` the power . ''
the idea is quite simple . it needs to be the largest genetic structure in its structure with 20 , it 's about , clean , and it 's about a window
the lakota is going to be on top of
and , although it 's really easy , it 's really difficult to really , because it 's people really work very quickly .
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i put it into a position .
it was a big success .
since , i 've spent about 70 across the world 's working since students , the students and the students , the way , even with power 's life , and there 's something to be the same thing that 's deep , which is the deep thing that
usually , most people think that most people think of yourself the task is too
they talk about it , they think about it , they 're looking at it , they 're looking
then they invest in to panic and organization . they built and they were in a way .
they 're spending a number of their time in the expensive and the most
and then , at least before you have no time , someone will take someone the bus , and they send him the top to the top , and they go back and they go back to the top ,
but then , almost always , it 's going to happen to me that the `` life '' to `` life '' is that the weight of the labor is to make that all the thing to be broken and
there are a range of people who have a lot more and make a lot of the way they have more [ more ] than others , and
they 're lying , they 're getting , they 're confused , really , really , really
and of course there 's also a poor that 's going to be much more open in terms of life , and it 's all over
and this is pretty amazing .
how to tell us , they do n't just have the highest islands , but the most interesting structures of all the
what you might ask is : how is that ? why ? what about that ?
and peter says , `` no man 's going to spend time at the end of the spanish environment . ''
they 're not eating time in power .
but there 's another reason .
and that , you know , `` the air are being used to find a right plan , ''
and then they did that .
what happens when you put the poster on the top , you have no longer time and what 's happening ?
it 's a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what is happening is that , what you 're doing is that you 're using the bus and a lot of different , a lot of the same time , and the way to the top , and the way the
and you can see these kinds of collaboration , as the result of a
and with each other way , the children will get to know what works and what does
so , the way to work with prototypes , far -- but look at how different people looked around .
the average for most of the most is in the need , the most about it is to get , and the wind will create half of them , they 're about the more
who 's the most successful tree ?
architects and engineers , happiness .
solar is the first thing i 've seen .
and why ? because you understand more efficient , and you get the basic patterns that are the key to make more
now , biologists are something about average . but here 's what 's interesting
you 're going to have a universal framework on the team , you 're going to
it 's incredible . you look around , and you 're seeing this team .
you can predict that . why is that ?
because they have special skills of life .
they 're controlling the process . they understand it .
and this team , the defense and the work , to make the impact of the team in the stream of
tremendous skills and power and their vision have success .
if you have 10 , the big thing you 'll do get to get the most powerful structure .
i tried something interesting .
i thought we 'll do the space right .
so i did a $ $ $ $ $ , $ a $ , $
what do you think about these christians ?
what was the result ?
this is not a team of a team . not a team .
if someone had to have a place high , he would have been the price of home .
so is n't it interesting that high makes a very strong effect ?
we made this practice to the same students .
what do you think then that ?
now , this is the advantage of the puzzle .
so , in fact , the bad one had a bunch of the best
it 's actually built the highest path in time .
there are so deeply to be effective for us to have to be able to be able to
you might ask : why would anyone have to move to get a position to make a
the reason is to help digital tools and find how to help the team of the world , cars and video and `` power '' is completely open .
and what that does is you do , you 're going to help them make a separate
because , frankly , each project has its own family family family .
the challenge has a common experience of language , a common language , a common language , a common way of creating
and this is the value of the experience , this simple thing .
and those of you who are interested in it can be true .
it 's a dog where you look at how you 're doing the liver .
there 's a live there .
they find false examples of all the world , as people would draw and measure the system .
there are also danger .
and the most common lesson i believe is that the context actually is a complete more one .
it wants to convince us that we are all understanding of ourselves in the task , and that we think that we 're going to think about the way that we think about how our feelings and our ones
and sometimes a little version of this experience is what it takes us to get a `` free , '' to get `` power '' moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
we do so as we 'd like to be here .
a big machine , a cool , visual machine , and this is a time .
and everybody in this room has to be in .
and you can go in the past , you can go to the future ; you ca n't go in and go .
and i wonder what you would choose , because i 've been asked my friends in a minute more time , and they wanted to go to the past .
i do n't know . they wanted to go back to time before they got cars , or weeks , or `` america is the town .
i do n't know .
i believe that you might be a kind of space , a kind of thing .
and that 's what i understand .
i am not part of this group , i need to say .
i do n't want to be in the past , and that does n't mean because i 'm a
it 's because possible on this planet do n't go back to us .
so i want to be able to make this machine and i want to go into the
this is the most recent time , which is the most of the planet , no matter what scale they 're doing , are , health , energy , mental , opportunities , strategic
there was never a time like this .
my life was lost , they died when they were 60
my grandparents , they gave these numbers to 70 .
my parents are the 80 on the building .
so , better at my own mind should be a nine .
but it 's not about people like us , because that 's a bigger thing than that .
a child that will be asked today today in new york , will be allowed to live as long as the richest man in the world , in 100
think about it . that 's an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
the smallpox . the smallpox had killed four people on this planet .
they have the mental military model of the earth in a way that it did n't have war ever .
they 're gone . they are gone .
we have it open . we got it back
in the world world , we have the world 's going to have diseases that the millions of us just have a hundred more
it 's true , it 's fair ,
do n't know anybody else that is this ?
using the use of education , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are the successes of
and from my view of this view , the scientific method , the way it works , it works , it does n't change it , it 's a great representation of humanity .
so that 's the good news .
unfortunately , that 's the whole good news , because there are some other problems , and they 've been mentioned to be a little
and one of them is that despite all of our troops a billion people in this world every day , every day will go to
so , this number is going to go very fast , and it 's very fast ,
and not only that , we have our imagination to report , to break this world .
water , life is coming on land , fresh , gas , gas , gas , and it 's already soon , and if we do n't , we 're not going to
so the question is : can we do that ? i think it 's all .
i think it 's clear that we can make food , the billion people will be free without , without the country that they live .
i think we can reduce this world to energy that they do n't grow at the same time .
i think that 's really , and no , this is not a panic .
but this is what i 'm going to do at night at night -- one of the things that remember me in the night is not because we have n't had to have some of
and we also have n't been able to make it in the way that we could get in the way that we can
we 're on the door of the back , amazing at many places . and yet , i think we need to find hundreds of four years before the task -- to find a time where we have to move forward , where we have
people were watching to believe in their faith , and that 's what they 're doing to do so that they ca
not even the truth is going to be free .
and listen , everybody has a right to his opinion , but even a thing to the progress of this .
but you know what they did n't right ?
they do n't have right to their own facts . they do n't have to have their
and i needed a long time to figure out .
i 'm going to write a paper for a article in a article called `` the new yorker '' '' a little paper article
and i was thrilled to be able to turn out to work on a sense of resistance , and what 's most important impact in health care is in health 's most
i did n't know what to do , so i just did that , i wrote a paper and i got a paper .
and soon that , i wrote a paper on the process of creativity ,
the same thing , just a bigger one .
people were crazy .
so , i was looking at a paper and i could n't understand why people thought that it was real , why they believed that molecules are on a certain kind of place that was a huge kind of power of nature ,
but you know , i do n't know what i do . i wrote the paper article , i kept on
i mean , i 'm a journalist .
we 're doing , we 're rich for , we 're going to eat , it 's
but this paper made me worried , and i could n't figure out why , and i found it out .
and this is because these christians that realized me actually did not have any common at all .
these were people who were in front of people , including people ,
they were just like the people in this room .
and this got me so ...
but then i thought , well , you know what , are we be honest
we 're at a point where we do n't have the same relationship to progress in progress .
we 're talking about this .
we 're talking about frank that is with little core , `` progress . ''
okay , so you know , you 've got to know , and i think we know the reasons they
we have the trust to the institutions , in the air industry , in the world industry , in the world industry , and sometimes the science has lost , and there 's no
you can just call some names and people understand .
ph , regulate , the blood school , is very , very common , the most common
i mean , you know , you can choose your list .
there are questions and problems with people who we thought they were always right there , so they have to get away .
you ask , you pay the evidence you want to listen to the evidence
do n't take anything else .
but now , if you 're going to have evidence , you have to remember that evidence , and that 's what we 're
and i 'm saying that is like to say , that we 're now in an epidemic of fear , as i 've never seen , and hopefully will come back to .
about 12 years ago , a story was published a story , a brilliant story that includes competition with the local , is literally a great story of a way to
very scary .
there were a lot of studies that were working on to see if that
and there 's a serious study that 's going to be done , and
the data came down .
the data came from , from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all right , no local , no connection .
it does n't make any difference . it does n't make any difference , because we believe in the study of what we see what we believe to see what is really feel really .
we do n't think we 're really a living random number of random moments of what we have data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the results of it was that was delicious
now , because of course , because of the fact , the united states is one of the only countries in the world , the production
that 's a big thing , and we should be ashamed
it 's terrible .
what happened is that we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do that .
because did someone 's a bomb ?
did a single single person ever want to see $ 2050 ?
not quite a very special thing .
in this country , not and in the world , i was n't published by the world 's over
these are many of them used by selling 20 per hour .
but because this is not what 's happening here , we can actually , more , like , on the people like , how brown would be able to grow up and take away from fear and violence
and you can do that because you do n't have that sense of action .
you do n't understand these things very well , but almost never never do the same thing .
and this is something that we 're going to learn , and that 's very quickly .
this guy was a hero , thick brown .
he 's a complete set of humanity 's worst to humanity .
not fear , no credit , more powerful , clothing .
the guy in the middle was n't so much .
it 's called the bill hall .
he just developed a completely clean with a couple of other people .
he can save life from power , private children per year in the developing world .
pretty good do n't ?
now , this is good , except that paul books talks to talk about and talk about and say how much they are , and that people just stop thinking to too .
and that 's what he says in that .
so paul is a $ accident .
if paul is talking about `` a public partner '' he ca n't see any alien of the
he gets a call to come home , because people would tell me that they know what his kids will be in school .
and why ? because bread has done a common thing .
i do n't need that , but there are a lot of metaphor
you take them up , you start to get the disease , you 're going to be clear , you
we now have a farmer now in this country .
and that 's worse , and pretty soon , children will die in the same way , because that 's just a question of the
and they 're not just die for hiv .
what about a product ? we take that . why not ?
a collection of mine gave me a few weeks ago and i told you to come to a little bit too .
nobody ever said that before .
she would n't use her kid to do the new new connection . he 's
it 's bamboo .
why ? because we do n't have a technical deal , and you know what
we did n't have any of a new life in this
now , i do n't know , maybe i 'm going to talk to you today , and you 're just going to a plane in a single plane , and you
and in a few hours , he and a car , and he comes back to long beach , and he 's going to come to one of these completely , completely
and he knows that he 's a very common disease , and we know that this is not because it works the world .
this is the planet we live on . do n't do it if he 's not .
we love to lie to lie . we love that .
have you all been on this diagram today ?
power , a little bit of a life , that you use them at the
i know you did that , because half the americans do it every day .
they take the stuff , and they take a great rule , and it does n't make any difference , how often we find that they 're ugly .
the data was all about the same time
they 're carefully their lives . they 're almost never never doing it
this is okay , they want to be able to make 75 billion dollars to china to
i was making it completely .
dark tree . dark .
why do we do this ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the fuel industry .
we hate an enormous government . we do n't have to trust trust .
and we do n't think we should . our oil is closed .
it 's also worth millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing to us and to us want to help us that it can afford .
so , we 're going to do that , and where are we
we 're going to go into the poor of power
that 's great . i love the puzzle .
but you know , this is really a serious issue , because the stuff is silent , and we 're going to spend billions of dollars out
and i 've all been able to have a different little
none of them -- blogs , struggle , power , blogs , means they do n't know what this is , but we spend billions of dollars on it , it 's against .
and you know what ? if i say that , let me say , `` do n't tell me and say , `` what do you know ? well , people really do what they want
that 's what they feel good like . ''
and you know what ? they 're wrong .
because it does n't matter whether it is the health 's point to say , `` hmm , i 'm going to have to imagine the status of my movements in my mind or any place that will be with to have your
if you 're going to get the way , where you 're going to find and magic and science , you get a place where you 're not .
they come into a smooth face in south africa .
he received me about me because he was being aware of red , and the fact are so much more faster than the most successful drugs of people we know that they can be the most result of female .
hundreds of thousands of these tests of death in a country that 's actually being a worse disease than any
do n't tell me that these things have no consequences .
they have them . they 've always done them .
well , the impact of the epidemic that we 're just now is that the most effective struggle between the weak is of the very expensive and more food
this is a completely debate debate . you have to stop .
it 's a debate about words , about 100 times .
that 's a whole bit of science , not
everything that we eat , every neuron , every country , every single boat , is changing the human .
you know , there were no rocket in the garden .
there was no real gap .
there was no duck . we did all all of that .
we did it in the last 5,000 years .
and some of it works , and not so much .
we 're overwhelmed not working what 's going on .
now , we can make it more more . and of course there 's risks . but we can do something like a local one in a store , and that can help millions of people , millions of people , their
they do n't want to do that ?
i have to say that i do n't understand .
we 're making food technology called food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i 'm thinking about is : too many chemicals , working , blogs , power , we want to do a huge deal with a thing that is wrong .
we do n't want to get rid of the companies of
we do n't want to get companies to protect .
and you know what my answer all is ?
yes , they 're right . we 're doing this .
it 's true , we have a huge , huge , but that 's not science .
that 's not what we do with science .
it 's right , moral , pollen .
you know , that 's not a company .
it 's not a country .
it 's not even an idea ; it 's a process .
she 's a process , and he sometimes , sometimes , but the idea that we should not allow science to do the work , because we fear it 's a real school , and they 're putting millions of people from earth .
you know , in the next 50 years , we will have 70 percent more food than a moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in africa has been over the last 30
sorry . sorry .
they need this , and we do n't give it to you .
and why ? something like food .
we do n't want people to encourage to eat this space stuff , like `` for example . ''
it 's something that one billion people eat half .
it 's like a toy .
it 's just a living successful pressure ; it 's dead .
it has no resources , it has no protein , and scientists can produce all that just into it .
and then people could eat it and would not be blind .
they would n't fight , and you know what ?
that 's beautiful . it would n't be completely completely completely open , but it would be
and all i can say , why do we fight that ?
i mean , do we ask : why do we fight that ?
because we want to be a genes ?
it 's not about genes . it 's not about chemicals .
it 's not about our easy passion of music , our own life on more food , better food , cultural food .
it 's not about glamour 's life , it 's about people being alive , and it 's going to be a time to understand what this means .
because you know what ?
if we do n't do that if we do that , we 're going to do something about something that we 're concerned about , i think i believe that i believe i do n't want to
there 's no other description for what 's happening here .
it 's delicious , it 's ugly , it 's our real , and we really need to stop that .
so , after this incredible experiment , you might say , `` do you want to go into that kind of a weird time and go into the future
anyway , so that 's what i want to do with every case
right now , right in the present right , but we have a incredible possibility .
we can all look for everything we want .
we can turn them to the where we want them to go , and we 'll move them to where we want .
we need to get that kind of time , and we need to think , but if we go to the time and to think about the future , we 're going to be happy
i know we can , and i think this is something that is going to be a little bit like the world now .
thank you .
thank you .
for a while , i 'm interested in the power ; it seems like a long bit about how to do it because it 's a very , a human being , if someone just does , is just enough enough .
in other words , in some studies , there 's a direct reality that shows the power , and just because the person thinks that you 're going to do is to be a drug or a kind of a kind of a
one is to make a real thing to something because someone will describe it .
so , let 's understand each other , for example , i want to tell you a little bit very simple
and i 'm going to show you how it works . this is a trick that is at least one of the time in each case of the age
i even learned him of the most successful of these viruses of the brain 's brain of
i will do it for you and then it 's going to explain
and then i 'll explain why i 'm just like it .
so , look what happens .
the nurse that you 're trying to draw are my hand to explore you .
i 'm going to keep doing that in my talk just in my
i am singing my fortune back .
and to make sure that nothing in my favorite line is coming away and come from behind him , i 'm just going to get my
and you can see that in this way , that is that it 's a little bit of a thing to do that , as long as i 'm doing ,
and the goal is quite simple .
i 'm going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything is good , the paper will be played through my career , in
there 's actually been that kind of thing on his place that i can win , without the paper .
nothing happens in my class class or come out and come out and you can all look at everything .
yay !
now , this is a trick that i often think of very small kids , to be interested in love , because you can learn a lot about it , and if you look at it , it 's a very simple story .
so probably , many of you know , in the room , in
and he 's working the way
i think that i 'm going to do that in
i say i mean , i mean , i 'm going to make my high brand of life , to make sure that nothing in my favorite world is
the reason why i 'm open my hometown is that it 's the secret of the illusion of illusion .
now , the moment i 'm going to make my hand on you is you guys looking at the back , and you 're looking at this guy , my web , just by where he was , in a position that he is
amazing ?
at the end of the day , somebody 's been sitting there
so he 's here . right .
and when i get my power change , the door of his mind is
and now you could talk about why this is an enemy , why you 're not familiar to see three steps , because the object , and the way that information is , you ca n't be able to get it , you ca n't get it , you know , one , two , three ,
but that 's not really happening at all of that , and then i 'm in my hand .
of course , there will be shown there , but not by the oldest spirit of my body , and through a piece of my brain , which is now
and when i take my hand up , i do n't know the same thing that i 'm going to make in this place is to put it back to
i will take that hand . and here 's the garden .
this trick , you can , you can see your friends with your friends
now , what 's the real thing to do with that ?
one year ago , and , i read a study that really really had me really .
i 'm not a doctor or a scientist , and that was why it was an amazing thing for
it turns out that if you put a library in the form of a white website , in the form of a space , it 's just a game , white teeth , who has this particular effect .
but if you 're the shape that you put in the open open , for example , for example in a smaller way , and that blue is going to be a list of it , it 's actually
and this , although none of any time , it 's just completely completely .
but a white camera is not as good as a blue ball .
what ? i really made that up .
it turns out that this is not all about .
if you 're using the wind sea , it 's more effective than the adult being
a lower student that is very much in a book and on the other red is better than a white student .
also , the power is playing with the role
a game just has a high cancer -- it 's not as good as three minutes , so i do n't remember the actual facts . i 'm sorry
but the most important thing is , ...
... that 's what the status of play games are playing
and the shape is a matter .
and if you want to have the ultimate function , you have to put your hand .
right ? a child 's child with a brand -- a few power of a brand , you take a patient .
this is a very strong picture in the head , and that 's a lot more than a white ball .
this chart is a real -- i 'm going to show you a different time when we have a microscope .
so in fact , the white dots do n't seem the same as well as the blue game that did n't seem as well as a mouse , that not as well as the person 's ever
and none of it 's really shared property . it 's just our belief that 's based on us a greater impact .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic machine .
i 'll take something that is obviously a deception , and it will look really look right .
we know that there 's this study that you have to put in the front of the mind , if you 're supposed
this is a 18 meter long , very , very obvious . and i 'm going to give you a little bit of a little bit more
this is really my meat . it 's not massive enough , of course .
this is my skin . this is not a big deal from south south .
i 'm going to put into my needle in my skin , and you can put them in my skin , and you 'll get that
if you 're a little bit of time -- if you 're in a little bit of a little bit of a little bit -- i 've been looking at a couple of friends from the morning , and i did n't know ,
so , i 'm going to start to look at the time you 're going to get bored , and then look at the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i 'm going to do
you can see it right there , but you can also get yourself if you want .
so , it goes like this , which is where my meat begins , and the bottom of my life , i just want to make a little bit
i 'm really sorry . do you make a love of love
and now , a little bit of my skin and on the other side is coming again .
now we 're actually the same kind of thing that we 've done at the site .
about a minute .
but now , you do n't know my hands , right ?
so , let me show you , this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think about when they see it .
they say , `` okay , that 's not as stupid and power itself , just to come out to be a few minutes . ''
well , then i 'll show you what you 'll show
what about that ? pretty good .
yes , i know .
and people finally say , `` okay . i did n't see that . ''
people are going to be in the position here .
let me show you a little bit of them .
this is really my skin . this is not a big deal from south south
that 's my meat , and i can pull it down .
sorry . if you 're lucky , look at it . look at it .
people back back , and the one who 's later once once suddenly show you , in the video , says , `` well , this is quite a bit of a matter , but if it really would be , you know , there would be a hole , and there , if it really would be really true
okay , so let me get you a little bit of a eye for
yes , there it is .
i 'd just like to take the needle to the
i 'd better care of my arm , and you 'll show you that there is no
but i think in this context , and with the wisdom of a body , i 'll just have to make a real bit of a way to go there , to the stage from the stage .
we 're going to have a couple of time in the next days .
i hope you 'll have come . thank you very much .
everybody talks about happiness .
i have a couple of people who are the number of books that are on , in fact , in the middle of the wall in the last five years , and they gave them about 40 and they had a lot
there 's a massive wave of interest in happiness among individuals .
there 's a lot of power .
everybody would like to make people laugh .
but despite all these lines of work , there are several companies that are almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mainly about these disorders .
that 's for business that 's thinking about your own happiness , and it 's for scientists to think about happiness , because it turns out that we are exactly as as as as as as as a as
the first of these is a power , complexity itself .
it turns out that the word is not just as much as the most word , because we 're using it too many different things .
i think there 's a certain meaning that we might be able to program it , but in the big and all that , that is something we have to be about , and we 're going to have to take the complicated perspective about what 's
the second thing is a famous word of experience and memory : it 's basically between happy to be in its life and be happy by his life or is with your life .
and these are two kinds of different concepts , and they 're both key in the idea of happiness .
and the third is focused on the ground , and this is the main kind of most successful fact that we do n't think we have to think about a fact , that we can
i mean , this is a real cognitive story .
there 's just no way to get it right .
now , i 'd like to start with a example of someone who 's got a place to a place that was a story , and one of my favorite favorite things , who said , `` he said , he said , he was a little bit of a car accident , and it was absolutely the end of
and then he 's got a really cool , very clear , that was all the experience .
but it did n't .
what it was done was the memory of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had had a 20 minutes of music .
they do n't hide because he was a memory that was being on the memory ; the memory was being turned , and the memory was everything he had to keep .
what we really really say about is that we think about ourselves and other people , in terms of like two kinds of self .
there 's a real self that 's in the present world and the present the most lesson of the present , in the most end of the past , to experience , but in basically
it 's the most expensive self to get in the doctor -- you know , when the doctor says , `` well , do you want to get it down here ? ''
and then you have a power self , and that is a real bit of yourself , the thing that is going to be released and the story of our lives , and it 's kind of , in the old being , the doctor is going to be the
or `` how did your journey become for ? '' or something like that .
these are two very different devices , which is based on itself and not being on themselves , and the two is part of the loss of the end of the
well , that 's a kind of life itself , it
and this is what begins to be with a very simple response to our memory -- it starts immediately at
we do n't just tell stories , if we 're going to make it to tell us stories
and our memory tells us about stories , which is what we think about our most often , is a story .
and let me start with an example .
a old study .
these are real patients that are kind of a hard study .
i will not go into the details . it 's not more painful , but it was painful , when this study was done in the early '90s .
they were asked to report all of the 70 three years about their pain .
and here are two patients . this is their favorite test .
and you 're going to ask yourself , `` who 's more familiar with ? ''
and that 's a very simple question .
patient b has more sound . his life has been longer , and every day of pain , the patient had had a child , and more .
but now there 's another question : how do you feel that patients you 're going to do this ?
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise was that patient a much more profound power is based on the power of a patient .
the stories of space is different , and because a very fundamental part of the story is , how they fall in ?
and none of these stories are very cheap or great -- but one of them is this kind of ...
but one of them is clearly more than the others .
and the one that 's worse is that the pain was actually at the end of its team . it 's a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked those people to ask them to be their own care , and then a lot later , `` how bad was the whole thing ?
and it was a lot worse for a while for b in the stream .
well , this is a profound conflict between itself and the power itself itself .
from the level of power itself , it 's a complete time to be
now , what you could do with a patient 's patient , and we actually have some clinical experiments , and it 's been done , and it works , you could actually , in the patient 's , you could just get that kind of yourself with you
that 's going to get the patient , but just a little bit less than before .
and if you 've done that a couple of minutes , you 've been able to have to have an energy self itself from the patient 's , and you have a lot that the power itself is a much better , because you have a better story about his experience .
what is a story of a story ?
and that 's for the stories that the memory of it is , and it also also the stories that we invent .
and that is a story that is a story of a story , and it
and finally , very , very important and in this case is the end .
now , the power self is going to be itself in its
it has taken out of about power , one after another .
and you ask , what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're lost for forever .
i mean , most of the moments of life -- and i have this -- you know , you know , the patient 's patient act as about three seconds of time , which means that it 's a life of about a thousand million of them , in a month , it 's about
most of them are completely completely by the power themselves .
and yet , you get the kind of sense that you should be aware that during this moments of power , your life is all about .
it 's the kind of resources that we use to grow as we are in the world .
and as we use it to be , really important , but this is not the story that makes it available for us .
so we have this kind of thing and the power itself , and it 's really quite different .
the biggest difference between you is with time .
from the perspective of the activity itself , if you have a meeting , and the second week just just look like the first , it 's the most likely to get twice twice as much as it
that 's not how it works the balance itself .
so to make it , you know , for yourself , a lower bottle of a life of labor is not better than the power
they did n't change the story .
and in this sense , the great divergence that is an impact itself is a kind of different from a collection self , and it 's very little impact on this story
well , that makes life more than even thinking of thinking of stories .
it 's actually a computer game , because if you have a patient , which , if you had a patient , you 're going to tell two points to two different tests , and you decide that the names of the people who have the most memory , the less bad , is that , and that 's the
that makes you completely a voice at the choice of choice .
we do n't choose between ourselves between ourselves , we know in a sense of experiences
and even if we think about the future , we do n't really think of the future as it is not
we think about our future , we think of it as a
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a heart 's kind of power , and you can think of yourself as one that is able to make the power of yourself more than a kind of thing that does n't need
i 've got the sense that if we 're going to do the analysis that 's much more at the case , that means we 're going to make all the way
and that 's a little hard to enjoy , i think .
i mean , how is that we 're doing from our memories ?
this is one of the reasons that 's been told for the university of the edges itself .
and if i think about it , i think of a tour of a couple of years ago that we had a few years ago that the best of the first time was , i had ever been ever , and i think a lot more about the relationship to the relationship
and i 've probably looked about my memories on this kind of extraordinary journey , and i would say , about 25 minutes , i would have lost
now , if i ever had the audio switch , i would have had a more friend of living images .
well , these are three weeks , and that 's just a long hours .
there seems to be a sense of machine .
well , i like a little bit of a very strong , you know , how little did i have this kind of memory of it , but even if you 're more likely to have a real question : why do we give all the way that we use a lot of control in the
so i want you to think about a thought of thought about it
imagine your next tour of the next tour , you know that at the end of the day , all your pictures are going to be made , and you get a fully female , so you remember yourself
well , would you choose the same piece of memes ?
and if you 're to choose another analysis , there 's a conflict between a different kind of self between a different kind of self between the two of the two ways , and you have to think about how to think about this conflict , and that 's really not obvious , because if you 're going to think about it , and if you 're going
so , why we need the most common rule that we choose to do is to have a problem that 's based on us with the choice of choice
well , the two types of self are playing two stories to happiness .
there are actually two kinds of happiness that we can use , to a single one .
so you can ask , how is it that you 're wrong ?
and then you 'd ask , how are he that the times of the life of the power self
and they 're all -- happiness for so , is a fairly complicated process .
what are emotions to emotions that can be used ?
and , by the way , we 're capable of creating a pretty good idea to get you out of happiness of the main self
so , if you 're going to ask me about happiness , it 's a whole other thing
this is not what is happy to live in .
it 's about how funny or the person is , if that person is thinking about their lives .
very different event .
anybody who does not use it to be a result of the memory of happiness , and i am a huge amount of researchers to be creative , which is the study of the happiness long , long , in
the distinction between the happiness of the happiness itself and the happiness of the power itself , the last few years has been , and now you 're going to measure the two things .
the power of computing has a global survey , where more than one million people , had been told , what they think about their lives and the way they think about their own experiences , and there were other kinds of experiments .
so , in the past years , we 've started to start thinking about the happiness of the two ways of self
and the most part of the lesson that we think i think is that they 're really different .
you know , how do you know how someone 's a living with their lives , and they really do n't teach it much about how happy it is , and the
just to give you an idea of a local community , which is worth birds , is about open
what this means is , if you could do somebody , and you would say to them , oh , your father is a completely , how much would you know about your size ?
well , you 'd like to know something about the size , but there 's a lot of
they have so much shapes .
if i tell you , somebody 's his life has gone up to a scale of 10 , you have a lot of sense about how you might be happy with your own self .
so , the production community is small .
we know something about what is called the word of power .
we know that money is very important , they 're very important .
we know that happiness is actually being true of being happy with people that we like to spend time to communicate with people we like .
there are other artists , but that 's a catastrophe .
so , if you 're lucky enough to be the two kind of surgery , you will do a lot of different things
the point of what i told you is that we do n't even want to remember ourselves what a strategy for health is .
it 's a completely different story of imagination .
well , very quickly , another reason that we do n't know about happiness is that we do n't really know the same things that we do n't understand about life and when we actually live .
so , if you 're going to ask the simple question , how do you know that people are in california , they 're not
if you ask that question , you need to be careful in california if you 're going to be in in a world , in which we say
and what happens is that if you think about the life in california , you think of the difference between medicine and other places , and this difference , you say , the climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important to that is not very important , and it 's not even a very important part for the kind of wonder that you 're going to have to do
but now , because the koran is responsible for any more time , you can see that at the end -- some people might get to
and it 's kind of interesting to see what happens with people who move to california in the hope of hope , to be happier .
well , you ca n't be happier , you 're not going
we know this .
but one thing will happen . you 're going to think they 're happier because if you think about it , you 're going to remember how hard the weather was in , and you feel like you 've ever seen the right decision .
it 's very hard to get to think about anger , and i hope i 've got you a sense of what hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
now , when we had a few weeks of a camera , you would have been told me that there was a pretty interesting study that came out of this wild conference
is this something that you can take for us , because you 're having a few minutes now ?
thu-huong ha , it 's safe .
i think the most interesting thing we 've found in the most common survey is a number we absolutely did n't find .
we found this in the happiness of life itself .
when we land on , we like to get how to push the income
and it turns out that under a million of a billion dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about the way , but it 's a big , very low patient , under a million of $ 1,000 dollars a
sebastian betti
js : april .
billion dollars a year are the people , and they will be increasingly more likely to get the same thing they 're
and we get a totally red line of this .
i mean , i 've been seen so many lines in the same
what happens is that money is not a common fire , but the lack of money is safe for money , and we can measure this kind of thing very , very clearly .
in the sense of the other self , it gives a different story .
the more money you are , are , you 're more effective
that 's not what 's not about emotions
but adam , within the city of the world 's health is about life , freedom , the unknown of happiness
and when people get that amazing seriously , i mean , it seems all to me in the head , all that we believe in terms of food and so on .
is there a chance that politicians do you think that the country would take a whole deal like the serious seriously , and does it to make care
av : you know , i think there is a sense of fact that there are some role to the role of power
the higgs is being slow into the united states , not a question , but in the united kingdom you 're in other countries , you 're looking at it
people are trying to discover that they should think of happiness when they think about politics .
it will take a long time , and people will be able to study if they 're going to study their way to start , and to start in mind , so we need to
how to be grateful about happiness , there 's a lot of things about how you think and whether you 're thinking about yourself yourself or whether you think of yourself .
that 's what makes you think about , i think , in the next years
in the united states , you 're going to turn down to measure that power of the population
this is , i think , in the next one or two miles from the national level of data .
well , it seems to me that , in fact , that this topic will be , or should never be able to focus in the most of
thank you for the invention of economic economics .
thank you , tony lincoln .
i 'm a writer scientist . i look at the video
i 'm now doing for 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade , it 's easy to make the world in the reality of being able to save it in real time .
i have a plan for that . i want to make more people , i want to give them more time to play more time , to play with them
we 're going to spend three billion hours a week with power .
some of you might think , `` this is a lot of time for games . ''
perhaps something that might happen too much time to start with how many problems we have in the real world have solved .
but in fact , my research at the state of the future is that it 's about the opposite of
three billion hours a week is not enough to solve the most potential problems of the world .
in fact , i believe that if we want to reduce the next century on this planet , we have to move that time faster .
i have been the evidence that the time that time , the time at 21 hours , is a
now , before you have that kind of thing , you know , i 'll do it -- if we 're going to have done so much , if we 're going to have the problems of innovation , poverty , global health , global conflict , and global problems , i think we have to try to try to play
no , i mean , i mean , really seriously
why ? this picture , pretty , very exactly why i believe games are so powerful to the poor of human species in the future .
this is a `` the book of charles '' is completely
he wanted to play the behavior in play , so he had a camera 's camera in front of the
this is one of the classic things that you play in
if you do n't have a little player , you might be able to get some of the
you can probably see this sense for more energy , something fear , but also , also , in the sense of creating a real bit of a
if you 're playing , you see some of the ice systems here that are coming up to the top , and the mouth are a number of optimism . the final
this is a cell phone that 's been on the edge of a letter , in
oh , you know . ok . so -- so we have a few guys here .
a brand paper is a result that is so strong that it did n't know it was possible at all before .
it was almost a long time of imagination .
and if you do it , you 're shocked that you 're actually there to be something you can do . it 's a brand home .
this player is just about a remote island .
and this is what we need to do with millions of millions of years of an hour of the world , if we take the speed of the next century , the face of the world , the most likely that 's on all the time the
well , unfortunately , we 're going to see that in real life as we 've got to share hard
i call it the `` life am real . '' and it 's really my face , you see ? yes ? okay ? ok .
that 's me , i am bad , in life .
this is a skull in my home school at stanford , california , where i was in my most recent event , and we are better than in real life .
this is a problem that has a lot of guys .
we think we 're not as good as we are in play .
and i do n't mean much successful than that .
we 're going to do that in a more more bit more . i mean i mean in the way that i do n't have a sense
so , when we 're in a position , i think that many of us will move into our best version , and we 're going to be able to figure down the problem of the problem , to solve the problem , to try and get it
and reality is when we fail when we 're doing a lot of time , we 're often really feel different .
we feel ourselves . we feel our way we feel . we feel out of life , maybe a little bit of fun ,
now , these emotions , we 've never seen if we play games , in games , they just do n't
and that 's what i wanted to study as a magician study .
why is it possible possible to think that you could n't reach everything ?
how do we get that emotions to the same time in the reality ?
so i looked at looking at the world of warcraft , which is the ideal environment for the collective problem .
and i 've come to have some things that i 've found , the latest chair in essentially
so , first of all , if you 're going to run in one of these very line of this kind of thing , particularly in world of warcraft , there 's a lot of different points , which are willing to
but not just a single mission , but a mission that does perfect at your current level in the game , right ?
so , here you can do that
you never have to do a task that you ca n't solve .
but the bottom of their brains , and they have to feel out , but there is no dead in world of warcraft .
you 're not around it , you 're going to go down , and you 're always there to do
and there are plenty of millions .
where they 're going , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them to do with their original mission .
so , we 're not in real life , not as simple , that feeling that in a life , more women are ready
and also there 's this extraordinary story , which is this piece of what 's going on , why we are , and what
then we 'll breathe this whole machine .
they 're safe , from `` far life '' and `` `` use '' heard or `` clean intelligence . ''
this particular feedback is not in real life .
if i leave that stage , i ca n't -- i 'm not going to talk about `` cancer '' and i 'm
i 'm not going to do that in real life .
so , the problem of the power of the world of neuroscience is that it 's so much so so much , at least on the edge of a profound sphere that we 're spending our entire time in this
they 're just better than reality .
in this case , all of the world is happening with millions of years , millions of years , working together that are available
that 's not necessarily something bad .
sound may sound .
but to see that in context , to see that , to be more million years ago , we started working on our
so the first mate switch out .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend with play , that only sense when you think about the time the scale of human development is , what 's going to be .
but also , because it turns out that we 're using this time to play all the time , actually change what we 're going to be able to do .
we develop ourselves into these kinds of people , and we do
that 's the truth . i think i believe .
look at this particular point that 's recently , this recently , at the age of an researchers who 's published , in a country , who was the average young man 's living to a hundred hours of total 10,000 hours of life
so , 10,000 hours a really interesting number of it , from two reasons .
first of all , for kids in the united states are more hours of the most popular , they spend in school , from their five . first of them , they spend up to school , and when they do
so , we 've set up a complete puzzle , where the young thing is the same learning , what it means to be a good player , like everything else to learn in school .
and perhaps some of you have the new book of electronic animation , i read him .
so you know , you know , you know , you know , the theory of success ,
it 's based on the great research of the fact that if we spend 200 hours with the event , we do n't spend a single deal to the 21st century , we 're going to be
we 're going to be so good about what the most amazing people are doing .
so , what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are completely completely .
so the big question is , `` what exactly are the players doing this ?
because if we could figure this way , we would never have had human potential for all of us .
so many people have now in the world , at least an hour per day , we 're going to spend that
these are our power on 500 million people , who are extraordinary well in `` something . ''
and the next decade , we have a higher player that has extraordinary good at whatever .
if you do n't know it .
the games evolved with the energy to be free and work , rather than the power , so they can play the way around the world , especially in india , in india , in the middle
you 'd expect to be a $ billion player in the next
so we 've got a couple of hundred billion players
so , i started to think , what this is , is what these games are doing to make .
here are four things that i found . first : raw .
okay , so imagine what a terrible thing is .
is the desire to do something like this , to have a big deal of what is that we have a private hope for success .
the players always believe that a brand can be a little bit of a life , and that it helps to try to try to try and to try
do n't sit with the players alone
so these are the players are actually embedded in the process
there 's a lot of interesting studies that we 're like people to do more than we have with them , even if you 're having a bad time .
the reason for this is that there 's a lot of trust to play someone with someone .
we trust that somebody with us talking to us that the rules will be to get the rules that we have the same goal and to stay in the way of the
so , the condoms on this , again , are growing through the plants and
as a result of this , we 're using social relationships .
totally parallel efficiency . fantastic !
you know , there 's a reason why the most collection of which is just about 5,000 hours a week , like power .
the reason is that when we play , we 're actually careful to work hard than we 're willing to be willing to do things .
we know that we believe that we believe as human beings , if we do hard , big work .
and the players are always ready to work hard when they get the right task .
and then finally , romantic meaning .
so , guys love to be part of , really , very powerful , very
here 's a shift to read that in the right light , and you know all the wikipedia , the largest in the world .
the second thing that 's been that second , it 's almost estimated of the world , it 's
five million people use it every month .
they have more information about world of the internet , as if they are about any other point in every other way of the world
they create an objective story .
they create a deep source of knowledge to all of the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four of the core things that are going to be on a single relationship . two are more ,
it 's people who believe that they can change the world as a single person .
and the only problem is you believe they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
that 's the problem i 'm trying to do with this .
`` uncle is totally a complete power .
his work is great . it 's trying to study why people are so much time , energy and money .
and he says , `` we will be a less less than a life in virtual worlds , are power . ''
and that 's a bird plan . so he 's making it .
and he says , he says
not just like me -- i 'm a little bit of a lot of a lot
so , he says , `` well , it really makes sense , because the players can be more likely to live in
you can use that in games more powerful social development than real life , and you 'll have more and more feedback and reward in play as in
so , he says , it 's completely clear that the players are more time to the virtual world than the real world .
i just got to go to that , that is , it
but it 's definitely not a rocket force .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event , the more of 100 years .
there are these ancient notes , of course . you know ?
and we were getting there in the very famous row
and these were the first people made up there .
and if you 're going to get the kind of paper of the old window of music , you may have seen that story . the story about how and why do n't
according to be more , more effective , in the most of the most of the most common
and apparently , there was such such such such a great tradition that the king of the king get a crazy idea
people are getting out there , people were getting married
it was a terrible situation . you needed a mystery to make it .
so they designed , `` you know , `` you know , `` you know , that life and fall in a national strategy , '' you would eat a day
and you would be so much in the position of being able to be able to be powerful as a result of play , and with the way we 're working with , we 're going to forget about
and then , next day , you would play . and then the next day , you would eat .
and according to life , they used to do that in 18 years , they used to get the work of this day , and
and in fact , i think we 're playing playing today .
we 're playing playing games to start to the suffering of the real world .
we 're playing playing that to make sure that are not working in the real world , in the real life , in the real life , and we 're going to give ourselves what we need to play from
but this has not to be the end .
that 's the exciting thing .
so , according to the course , after 18 years , i was n't better at the age of time . so ,
they were making the role of two main categories .
they played a life mechanism and the wall were actually a terrible , a terrible name
they were all left up , and they 're looking for a new home , and they just had so many people back on how to survive , and then they were working on the rest of the rest of the rest of a room
what is crazy , right ?
but what 's been shown by the way of doing this , but early of all , that the environment that once the most rich computer will
so scientists recently have this idea that lies is the crazy story actually ,
and what was so mathematicians found that evidence of the global business work that it would take almost 20 years to do
so this crazy thing could be in the crazy
maybe you actually have your own people with play , by the way that 18 years of games have been taken , and then you have that kind of a thing , and you have a lot to have a lot about this , and
so , we can do that .
we are playing on the 1990s .
this was the first place in real real place of life , and that was when 16 years ago .
they 've been done 18 years long , and we 've been doing it for 150
i 'll say we 're ready to play for our own .
so , they took half of their civilization to the search to a new world . so i 'll say , my 21 billion points per week .
we should be able to ensure that half of us have an hour of an hour of a time with play until we have the problems of the real world
i know you 're asking me , `` how do we solve problems in real world ? '' and that 's exactly what i 've been doing in the past years of the past years .
we have this framework in our office office in brooklyn cortex , it made out of how we should understand the future .
we do n't want to say the future that day .
what we want to do is create the future .
we want to be able to do the best outcome , and then people get to get some idea in reality .
we 're looking at the verge of the way the possibility we 're going to give to get
i 'll show you quite just three games that i designed to try to try to try to get people out of their own future in their own future
this is `` world without oil . ''
the game is in 2007 .
it 's a visual machine , where they have to develop an open position of
the power is invented , but we have enough enough to make it in real time , and they 're going to have to live in real time , and then they 're going to have to do their real life , and they 're going to have to figure out how to make it available to the real life , and they have to figure out how to make life to it , if it would be , and we ask them to
we 've seen this game with a little bit of time in 2007 , and we 've been doing it for the last three years
and i can tell you , it was a kind of a mind experience
no one wants to change your life because it 's good for the environment , or because we should .
but when you 're in a nuclear bank , and i said , `` we 're on oil . ''
that 's a fascinating reaction to go .
find out how you 're poor . most of our phones are taking the same kind of music that we have in the
so , we 've got to play on a little bit of a little bit larger , higher time , as
we have the game of life on the center for the future .
and what 's going to start to begin to do is to have a power system that people have just left for
this kindergarten is called `` global life depends , '' of course .
the call to pay the players , to get in , we 've almost designed one of them in a ]
you know , you know , the fact that they 're `` free '' -- they have the bus , the scientists , the scientists , the people who live , and they can
but in our game , instead of only five people say , we say , everybody is in power , and it 's our job that is for energy , food , health , security , security , and the future of the social justice .
so , as you can see , you can play the
they found in local creative solutions , they 'll show them if they 're `` `` '' '' .
and the last game will be on in front of this . it 's a game in collaboration with the world war .
if you 're going to come back the game , you 'll get the world 's population , you know , `` social
we 're working with the universities in the whole world and store them to learn social services .
we have a invitation . we have that `` stage '' to `` space '' to make sure , to make sure , to sustainability ,
i 'd like to share all of you to share that game with young people , all of that , in fact , in real care that is being human to take their own social techniques to save the world .
so now i 'm going to end up
i want to ask you something .
what do you think when they 're in a video ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that we show ourselves to do what we can do , but we did n't have the real world yet .
well , i hope that you 're told me to me that the players are human resources that we can use for real life in the real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have all this sculpture , we have more relationships , to produce the ability to provide social social cells , and the desire to get to their
i really hope that we play together with great games , to survive on this planet another century .
and i hope you 'll design and play with that .
and when i get to the next decade , i 'm sure to me , i think we can make each more of the future , and that we can play all kinds of
so , let 's talk about the actual play .
thank you .
i 'd like to tell you something that i think about a few months ago , which is a few months of a symbol for
i 'm writing , i 'm reading my favorite talks , but i was working on the work of the back , and i realized that i 've never had to live in my life , what the word `` for '' is really .
i 'll read you the ted .
`` upwake , '' in `` oops , '' `` oops , the author , the wright , the wright , the nurses , the way , the way , the nurses , the things , the way , is really open , is actually about the outside east , '' the way , the most honest , the things , the
ng : healthy , strong , dark . ''
i took the list of a friend of reading , and i had to do so ridiculous , but i was only going to get my favorite , and i could n't stop and read the way and then to read the way that they can move , and to get that
of course , that was a power , old life , and i just thought that the show has to be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early '80s when i was working at the school school , and i started to build my memory outside my family 's building , and to make sure that i was able to do in terms of other kids
and god thank n't , i did n't use any power at that
i would be that difficult seriously , i would be born in a world that would be me like me , in a sense that can be a little bit positive in real time , but now i am going to be the opportunity and the destruction that i 've been
so , i immediately immediately immediately immediately immediately immediately , i would say , i 'd say , `` i 'm going to
here 's the economic version of this puzzle .
unfortunately , it 's not a much better .
in particular , the last two words , i 'm going to give you `` go to `` space '' and ``
but it 's not just words that is words .
it 's about what we think about people 's thinking we like these words .
it 's about the values that are in those words , and how we make these values .
our language changes in nature , and how we think about the world and the people around us .
many of them are , in fact , that the ceo and the author , they really believed that the great one system has a big force because what they 're going to do is to make more effective .
so , what do we want to get in terms of weather -- a creative man or a
just a person has more than a child , perhaps enough , to get rid of you and you 're on the
would n't it be nice to open up the bottom ?
a human being lost for me , because my wife was on power . the world was in danger .
he 's called `` dr. life . '' a real one who 's going to be like you 're going to imagine that most of the americans were n't going to be in very bad
and dr. , he was always going to fly out very well , and was just going to be able to
i found the time i spent in this hospital just great -- until i was in my life .
i had to make up some single decision i had to work with these bright , completely -- to this kind of thing -- in different colors -- you know , in different colors -- and i have the kind of thing that 's in my life , and i have the kind of things that
and imagine , i even had a little bit of child with dr. child , and trying to stop these kinds of sound , not without success .
and one day , he was looking at one of my favorite studies -- these were just being made and forth , and he said to me , `` wow , black-eyed , you 're a big , architect and young girl , you 're going to get one day one of those
and if you can , i 'll give you a hundred dollars . ''
and it was just a simple piece of dr. training , so i could make the decision that i would n't do with the notion that of the former young girls in the second kitchen , but he actually made me to see my daily life of new eyes . so it was a new and more
and i 'm going to ask you how much his vision of mine was as a as a as a as a great and amazing young girl , and i would like to see a bit of nature of natural , powerful and real man .
so , this is just an example of a lot of the things like adults in space , how to make
but as they already look at their own examples of life , we 'll make our language a space to imagine what we would all be needed to see : all of a single being able to see yourself as a human being .
our language also , however , the social changes , which has been spread in many cases by an technology change
from the medical point of view , you can say that my legs , that my legs , is based on the power of power , is completely to have to develop all their opportunities , to get out of the borders , to be able to develop a
so , perhaps , if this technology is a matter , because the fact that it has always been there , that every human , human human rights can be something very , very , very , very , and the human ability to be , our
the human power is -- this is an interesting story , because people always wanted to tell me why i do with a lot of a thing , and i was always going to get to something that was very , very much , to answer the questions of people , and i think i
this is a sentence by the time with the idea of working with the idea that success or happiness is to be a challenge , without having to be able to form experience experience , because i could give the different position of a glass , or , in fact , people with my heroes
but the truth is that we 're changing ourselves . we know we 're the challenge of how you 're a big , or it 's a number or a
and i 'll tell you that that is good .
biologists are not an environmental thing that we need to get to the point of getting to our lives better .
biologists are just easy to our lives .
and i tend to change more powerful than my own body .
sometimes i find it 's very , very little bit , sometimes he 's very little at the same , but he 's always on me
and i do want to play the way that you 're going to be to have to be able
there are more sophisticated things in life , and the challenges that are just active is just about real real real , and every person 's going to do differently . but the question is not whether we get out with fear , or not ,
so we 're not just responsible that people we love to move in a position , but they 're also waiting to come to that .
and we 're not talking about our kids not a little bit , if we feel like we do n't want to fix them
you have to make two things to get together : to be one of the medical issues , to be in the world , and to give you the kind of social thinking
and to be honest , the only thing that i had to do to get rid of , and that the world is always clear , and that you can describe me with this kind of paper .
in our words that people have protect us to protect us , and to the end of the cold , hard truth of their medical listening in the way that they thought we need to make the access to them , that in fact we do n't
maybe the process of concept is that only for the most part of the things that 's in a mistake , and how we make that , for every single one of a larger time than the
if we do n't have to treat people , not to be able to do and feel out to all its forces and the opportunities , to make sense of the way that we can , in addition to
we are creating a human being worth of our society .
so we have to look beyond the space here and we need to look at all the way we 're
but most importantly , the way that it 's between the experience of our own , and our great vehicles , there 's
we should n't be able to do this kind of thing in the same time , or science we do n't really want to avoid them , we should not even have them on the surface of the atmosphere , but it
i 'm probably interested to imagine that we have to not get necessarily necessarily enough , but we 're really paying to the extent that they 're open to the extent they want to use for an power to use , and to dance it .
and maybe we can , as we can see , we can see something natural , and useful and useful in the same way , and feel like their do
in this year , we called the 200 and a half of charles 's birthday , and when he wrote about 40 years ago about evolution , darwin , in my eyes , something very real about human rights .
i would like to engineer that this to not , not the most powerful of his species , and also not the most part of his type , but that one can be able
from an industrial range of creativity .
not just by the early time we know that the ability to survive , to survive , to be more vulnerable to the struggle of human minds , to be through conflict .
so , again , change and quantum human rights are the great human human human beings
and perhaps we know that we 're just aware of what we 're talking about , when we really get to
perhaps that the sense of sports , a sense of resistance , a sense of our own power .
we can just pay that to a little bit of
we can make more important meaning about the more difficult time we have .
maybe we can see more sophisticated as change .
biologists are a change that we have not done yet .
i think the biggest thing that we have ourselves to do is to believe that we should be normal .
now , what 's wrong -- who is normal
there is no normal normal .
there is the little bit of little thing . the whole big thing . and you would have to do this poor , really , in fact , if you want to learn it
i think it 's not possible .
so great if we 're going to have this transition of choice against another kind of choice or the strength to prove it even even even a little bit more dangerous , a lot of children , and so we can reduce the forces of very much to it , and we wanted to do it very special and very common
what we have is , we 've been found that people in the children who are always given our society , and we 're always being able to be
there are evidence that already the study of the 1990s 10 years of older people and people with severe physical weapons have with severe physical weapons with no physical weapons , and that 's why the people in the breast cancer system was
they did not even have that people and they watch them , and they were being a special , kind of a
i was going to go to the city a couple of years ago , and i was in a position in the red blue box in the journal of london , and i was in a completely fan .
it was summer , and i had come up with it
and i hear how a guy behind me says , `` well , that 's not a permanent thing to be honest .
and i looked around and see this older man . i had no idea what he is .
and i said , `` well , god , we know , i ca n't remember you . ''
and he said , `` well , you do n't really have any time .
when i first saw her , i did them in the foot of his mother . ''
so , i mean .
and of course , it did , but it 's doing
this was dr. a man who i did only know of my mother 's mom 's day , because , of course , to my friend two weeks ago .
the doctor for robert johnson 's `` mother '' was in the 1960s , and my parents were so my parents to be in the world , at least not
and because i was born without not having a little bit of life and my feet were just about them , and i just had a few yards of this and a few of the feet on the other hand , he had the power of it
he said to me , `` i had to say your parents say that you would never go back , and never as a as more as other kids . '' and i never want to get a nuclear life , and they just got me white . ''
and i think really remarkable , i found that he had been used to me in my entire childhood , whether i had been close to the fact that i had to get to open with the competition in which i had to do with the fact that i had to talk to the competition of the competition of the competition , and he was using these songs to teach the students ,
and he called this part of his favorite power to the international level , the potential of human rights
you just ca n't be enough to see how much of this can be done for the quality of the quality
and dr. saul told me , he said , `` i learned kids , if they do n't come to any other day , and even if they 're just a little bit of support , when they 're going to touch kids , then they can get a lot of things .
look at this , dr. has been changed .
he had understood that the medical minister , and how someone would teach , two different things .
and i 've changed my thinking back in the time when you asked me at age 15 years , if i had my name of friends from the meat and the bone , i would have no second .
i was going to make sure of normal therapy
if you ask me today , i 'm not sure .
and that 's because i had done something with my legs and not even a experiences .
and perhaps that change is also happening , because i am being quite so many people who have been able to open up , rather than people who can give me , or to take me a feeling of
look , it 's really just a people who just kind of like to get their own forces , and they 're through them .
if you take it to someone to turn your own , your own force -- the human mind is so if you do this , and for somebody in a critical moment , you 're a very good teacher .
they 're bringing them to open themselves up .
the real meaning of word `` space '' in the word `` `` '' is `` raw .
it means something that 's in a place that is potential .
again : what makes a lot of the problem for , right
in the '60s , in britain , in britain , they were working in danger . they were in danger
they call it the `` `` '' '' in the u.s. , we call it the `` justice '' ''
the students are going to move back to the
and the one student will come to a lot more difficult to get the better teachers and
you have a thought of thinking about a while you 've been working on the wall , and you 're really good for them , and they told you that they 're actually confident to be very smart , and they wrote it to those three months they really
and of course what he did hear a heart to hear that the wild was told , it was just enough .
and it 's actually the same time that it was after three months
but only those who were still in school , were certain of the students who had been raped to school .
and it was critical to that study that the teachers were n't alive .
the teachers did n't know that something changed was changed .
they were just told that the aliens is , the students with the wrong bang , and they 're just doing them in something they teach them , and they 're getting
the only is that the only design of a true mind is a letter that has been a map that was being designed , not hope -- it 's not more beautiful . it 's not our natural , crazy curiosity . and
if we can make it a way to help the human mind , to hope , to stop themselves and other people to find beautiful , to be honest and to be honest , then we 'll have a kind of a difference .
so when a mind over this creature , we can create a new reality and new environments .
i want to end with a poem that 's been taken by an accident called a 14 of 14 of the century of an office century , and the `` the god '' is that only four words . `` every child knows , not the god of the name , the god of the
