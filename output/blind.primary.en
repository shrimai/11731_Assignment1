yes , good day , my email , my email .
and it 's really true to talk to the computer here today .
and i have to think now , now now .
my name is ze 's birthday , and i 'm , silly , i 'm a little bit of loving
that 's called the `` eight years of eight years
and my favorite job is : first , first , second organization , new public care .
so i 'm for the verge of this city .
and that 's not what you do n't do .
i know .
and that 's when my son 's particularly , of course , i also have a privilege .
that 's what i 'm going to do is the head of
and tesla 's and short bush .
and i think , of course , i think of course , of course , to a matter of what i want to
so with the theme of the puzzle of the puzzle , because it 's very wrong
we hope to be the best and most of us on the worst of the worst , which is the end of
you know him .
he was in general grade .
and then i start something not to say a little bit about it .
i 'll give you one .
this is what we talk about if it might have a risk , that we are in a stage , we 're just going to be a
a lot of people are behind it
it 's called the case ; it 's got surgery
and somewhere on the edge of a text , a guy , and i left a little bit , maybe the person
nobody seems to be in this .
the text is n't one .
suddenly a symptom .
leave the marketing thing .
police is , six , c .
people call .
elisabeth up .
go out .
what 's that ? go on ? questions are coming .
we do n't know that , or we ca n't tell you .
people were leaving the building .
children died .
some people might see even though it needs to go fast .
suddenly a discovery .
there 's actually `` marketing '' in
a panic comes from .
i 'm going to hear this up here
the rest of the day , i 'm going
but it 's not a fake thing that i 've been building with .
that 's exactly what happened in the week in a coma .
there 's a little black one , you know .
and then they found out that they were in a wheelchair , nine pounds of drugs in it .
but people were just like this , and this is a friend that i tell you that , from the building .
it did n't really said anything .
and it was , in fact , in this particular conference , in fact , in the same of the group that my friend has
god , thank you , because no fear , otherwise , you know , it would n't have been such that it was
you see , in an fashion one , in a musical tradition , you see , a really important tool
communication is important because the people in this situation makes us more disease .
they want to know what is because go .
in the past days , ancient times , it was still the industry industry .
we simply have n't told it or we 've got it .
why ?
because the so-called is actually built in the
you have to be able to say , god , people will be in love with saying , `` god , we do n't even say the truth or we do
this is in a period of social media , in a time of twitter , in a time of a time from the private and the public community , in a time of muslims and the oceans .
simple and most obvious thing because it 's not an ideal and second in the second world is now in the world 's the last time that we 've
you may even be looking at the rate of the kitchen river , which is where it 's already a year ago
the first one i 'm going to talk about twitter
and i think , from a side of someone who was in a plastic store and i could put it and you could put it to the point of
that was not an accident .
you can see , we 're now ready to be able to go up with the fact of being able to go out and be very
because mostly , of course , we also are the last ones that will ever know the truth of the truth , because we are going to have the truth of the truth
and that 's where the public media or even private media ca n't either either be so much , or they do n't
from the way , we 're going to eat in food , and that 's also something that has a little bit of the media that we 're looking at , like we 're
and we 'll be able to take the good old and again .
but it 's only than one form of a surgery
that means we 're going to put in the next few years of about a hundred , in the square gallery , which , some of you , you know , `` oh , '' if
it was done .
you may know , well , you know , what they 're doing is that they 're going to have three days ,
i do n't know .
we 're going to have the same area with all the other stages that we have in this position , so i 'm sorry , with facebook , about the radio , about twitter , about the radio , and even the internet and the local media and so on , and immediately , of course , with
and we know that we have to go to it very quickly and we 're using it very quickly , and we have to have to get there very quickly and we 're
and we did n't even have the belief that we want to say .
communication , in the crisis , or in the tradition , is one of the reasons from which all the media we 're going to have to be in and it 's also a question of
so , in the top , we have our biggest problem , because the feedback and the men say either , you do n't want to say the job , or you say , the more things that 's going to do , or you
we also have good experiences with facebook and twitter , even recently .
and you might have some of those media going on in front of the media
we 've been asked a bigger wave in food .
and that is a so-called chemical vehicle .
these are mobile phones that are on the board board , because they should n't be able to get the first heart video song on the front of the crash , but by the trees in the second war journal , they 're going to have a little chemical reaction that will be able to find that a small journey that 's going to have a small
the problem is only to have a lot of these volunteers , and it 's been working up in the front of the other people in
and there were a decade of an older architect that he was so beautiful in that words , and it was , we 're now , he saw it , like you 're going to have an airplane â™ª , and now he 's now he 's now he 's now he 's now he 's
and then a couple of minutes , a couple of minutes , came out
we 're going to see what we find a lot of everything
these are the pain that they 're going to go to see on a place , not
and so we 've been able to play on a nuclear park and be able to make a way of word in a very sense of
and in fact , in the history of the city , the whole social system of facebook and twitter are going up to the basic level that all of the most exciting time there
and the media was crazy . it was coming in the background
we did n't even have to get out of the police ones , but they have an apple and they had a press
and the whole thing had a great effect for us , because the traffic box is going to have been dramatic and
simple to give you a sign when i 'm supposed to stop .
i 'm not going to see the watch of the watch .
this is the corner of the face , because first of all , the social media has the advantage that they can get
not so much , because the patients who are there or the bush they call you , you 're called a high job .
second , fast glass .
if something is n't true , i 'll say it 's a bit of a way to immediately you like , this high box , which i 'm just talking about , you 're going to be really going to
and it 's a very high pleasure , so if things is wrong , it can be done very quickly .
and we have a huge campaign .
i said , `` solomon , '' which was the idea of the idea of a car in the upper park .
from the way , we 've been seen from all of the things that are happening in the last few years , and it 's much more of a lot more than a half of them 's
and the city of the city can be able to take a very hour and a half
a woman who will have to be in a park , and that 's not what one of them is
but they can also be able to find a lot of time , and then we 're going to get our coffee coffee and try to go down and try it in seven feet .
and if you think of yourself as a business , think of the other cities as if it needs to be able to be able to be able to be an honest one , which you can do not know , you can see that we are now going to be able to do it
and this is important , of course , to be able to do it in a world of an infinite plane , and also to keep it care , in order to make it care , that people are the ones that are able to make the point that people are able to
and the social media helps us to be more transparent , because , in fact , all of the communication that you have to be in technology , and not just is just a single single kind of an individual canyon as we did in the coffee election , and in the case
from the point , today 's now is not just a chance of the government industry , not just a chance of the insurance or the crash , the minister , the encyclopedia , red computer , but of communication in the tradition and in a stage , we
and cochrane did this show .
there 's a lot of the kids sitting at twitter and over facebook a lot of the aid , if you 're going to have it just in the way that it was , because suddenly , there were some of the people who
this is still a lot to do , and it 's still a lot to the public economy in the late sector , but the fun brothers with the opera and the team has just shown that the social media made a rather more longer way of
and i hope i 've been making them a little bit of the fact that this medium , that was often so being used in the game of life , in general , in terms of the future of the future , even to the citizens of the future and for the people and the
thank you .
this is like a beautiful good evening .
i 'm an undercover different person .
i 'm a writer and an artist , as you 've heard right now .
and i 'm now still now to be a own demo .
what it is , i 'm going to make a tragic bomb , which i 'm going to do with you
before i do that , i have to make a couple of things .
the first one is , i think , is really , we need to live .
we could not live without stories .
and i also believe that there are a lot more , a lot more , i think , there are some sort of things that are actually
and then i believe that the internet , the infinite amount of high , is actually as good as the `` is really famous in a bad
and in fact , in 2006 , i 've been convinced to believe that people have been built for being
and they are happy , as soon as they can be creative .
the more people are happy , the better it is better than the world .
it 's very basic .
now , this better world is now just a contradiction .
in my mind , i 'm like , `` oh , '' like ,
and the story i want to tell you about is about a bit of a piece of a piece of a piece of game , in
that 's a shame .
and it 's an ancient prime ted .
now they get off of the water and the marketing war does n't really much as much as it , in the moment that it was used to be used to , something happens
it happens to be something in your head , in your body , with your sense .
and she did n't really have to ask anything .
they do n't know what happens to happen .
i have even words in it .
i call this the oldest portrait of the alphabet .
you can see one side and the test in front of that 's pretty yellow .
i have been , like , i feel pretty much a lot of
somi .
and on the other side , we have the two color and we have a lot of color on it .
and it 's in the same moment that i 'm better and i write , i was able to get a little better
so , the first thing about this in your new sense is a very , very flying man with a poet named hair who is sitting on her , she 's very serious , and he says , `` you know , your life is
that 's a shame .
and then watson 's favorite year-old talks to get to be a very special kind of man .
it was born as an accident .
players are people who have to play their own existence around their lifetime .
who knows you know ?
very nice .
imagine if the average unit system does n't take any muscle , if you 're going to take them to take them , it 's
so , dry , yo , mama , everything else .
what really matters is the players that do n't have any kind of thing on their
we do n't know when we die .
i wish every single life is a long place , but we just do n't know
it can be done at all of the time .
and i think it 's like my hands too .
they do n't know how much they can play .
that means every great day could be the last .
a player who has been fixed his entire life , in the moment of the competition as a device called the emergency .
now , you can ask , if that 's so dangerous , why are we going to do this ?
and the answer is clear : that 's what it
without play , without the weight , to get one around , to make all the dark , and only when a player play up , he
they were born with playing .
that 's like that
this story of the error and how you put the world of the player in the way that your first civilization is and of course , in terms of , in terms of , in terms of , the
and in fact , that 's a catastrophe .
the first one has 12 consequences , sorry , i 'm going to have a conversation that i 'm actually seen .
so , 12 of the people in the first row of view with a distance of five to seven minutes
this kind of a gallery -- a sort of a way of other , beautiful letters , that knows .
this is n't a little bit of tv for the tv
it 's not new .
and if it was everything , then i 'll be one right now .
and it certainly does n't happen .
now , here we go .
let 's go back to visit again .
what is the most famous sentence on the film or from the series of that
it can just be a hand , right .
thank you .
it would have been if we had this job
and that 's not true of my hands .
and of course , it can be quite many , many
there are so many different games .
just think of the kind of surgery , a lawyer , a child , a child and so on and
and that 's exactly what the most of the most successful sex is
and so , in fact , there are many other stories that they want to be
now the next question is , who should you want to tell all of this
i 've been a very high point of mine .
i think of an religious religious and extremely creative .
but i know a hundred brain can produce more than one , even though it is .
and so it came up to the idea that you can see the population of the brain process in the same
what if we were n't just simply just allowed them to use the only smile or the computer ,
so if you say , we 're really told to have a very short thing of the development of this bowl .
imagine if the whole bit three times of a sentence you can see in the most of the most of the most of the most of three and a half , that they 're
and also they 're a big fan of surgery .
you can just be able to just just be able to just just be a little bit more likely to do this , but not
and this store , she turned up on the board , and then she goes up , and that 's really cool , really , really , really , to get
that means that it 's not going to be somewhere somewhere , but it 's really just going to go up the ground
the really beautiful thing is that we 're in the internet .
and the web is , you can actually make everything .
so , every medium is kind of like it .
that means she 's going to be the audience , by the way , to write it as the blind , the
and if we even have a look at a moment here now ,
this looks like a little bit of `` ancient web , ''
this is a little bit of a toy project that 's
and i 'm really amazed of that the internet was born to tell exactly this kind of stories .
it 's just not that many , even yet no one .
so , now now -- i 'm actually going to go back to the audience a little bit , and just to become
in a nutshell .
there you can walk for the blood 's high school and also against the people in the real world , who also have those surgery on their mobile phone
and what we 've done is that they also know that they 're also very good , they 're sort of like mobile times and an
this wonderful areas of being a very slow place .
and i ca n't look at that , because i would have been able to have a little bit
we 're also doing together .
everyone 's got to share from three .
the first part is the one that 's the first time , and then we have the privilege .
so with that , i could actually had a little bit of a university of the university , and i have to take a little bit
they gave me the first price of the best leaders in my early business
and i have to say , these authors were from an innocent of the bronx 's jewish , and they 're on the board .
so clever people would , should i have .
and if i can convince the decision here with my : the internet will really make up structures that will improve the world , i think , i can actually convince everyone .
that 's like that
everybody 's like everyone 's time : why is this so it 's going to
because in five of it , all the wild is going to be
we have an idea of the phrase , who 's in the mind , i 'm a little , you 're in , everyone 's ever
of course , then you die .
in the sand , very much months .
everybody 's got to say , everybody has to die .
and of course , of course , everyone 's in the sense of everyone 's likely , if they like it .
that 's completely important to me .
i 'll come out of the plane and there 's nothing i think about my opinion when it 's like a disaster .
i do n't know if you know this .
if you 're in the theater , and you 're looking at the sentence in the jungle and everyone 's like , oh god , i do n't
and that 's not what it is .
so it 's actually 30,000 interaction .
and no one needs to be
he can just be his name .
the reason i 'm about is 10 speech is that the whole project will be on the dollar one .
that also has a few reasons .
i 'm going to go back to this project , and i 've been asked to it again , and i 've been going to go up and say , ``
i just want to say : `` the german canyon is the third of the world .
the surgeon 's crash is the english man , and then the german of the car .
so it 's not like we 're going to move into some little boxes .
and i also believe that i really really really really really , in fact , if it really is that people will be grateful to the fact that people were being grateful for something that was not published by any kind of old paper where they were at the
if all of this is happening , as i would like to do it , the first one will go to go down to the first
and if you ask yourself , why now i 'm now now here in a toy , where you can go to the crazy bush , it 's going to
i 've also had a couple of fun , too .
i love nonsense .
not just that one out .
i 'm very sensitive by a lot of surgery and an amazing
a few years had been in and also an accident .
and i really just tell you that this whole knowledge is incredibly important and incredibly painful .
but it does n't use anything if you do n't use it .
and my project is just the kind of thing i just made all of the way i 've learned so many of us
and it did it worked .
and that 's where it 's now right
can i really say it .
so , if anybody thinks , i do n't want to make a part of my own sense , i 've got an lucky person in a idea , i 've got a sense of a situation , and i always have , it
you find it in the internet .
on facebook .
great , how do the ted respond ?
yes , i 'm also saying that .
so welcome to you , can you use memory ?
question for you .
can you use memories ?
can you remember anything that your life is in your life ?
have you even forget ?
who has you who have to remember ?
there are no hands in the hands .
so , how can we use memories ?
it seems .
thanks a lot .
no , this is just what we want not to do today .
then the talk is pretty short .
and again , a little evening , my name is bill 's
the talk today , i was talking about the evening , and i was hoping to do that there are two of my favorite , or
i 've been looking at this in los angeles research , and i 'm just going to have the same speed and i 'm going to have to take a lot of the
and at least a moment i 'm also going to go up as a teenager and a half of the private
so on the one hand , i 've been able to do a lot of the computer , in the other hand , i 'm interested in the human being so the human being , the most important , the human thing , how does that
how do you think that ?
it 's a game game .
i 've been in a very interesting discussion about artificial intelligence , ancient capital .
so , the question was , when can we make a computer , when we can build a computer that 's like this , how about the human brain
so , and i have this , it 's already right on this .
so i think that two , three hundred years , even the other thing n't do .
but let me try to do the idea that what might need this would have to happen to you
so the feedback between the computer at the one hand and our brains on the other side of the other
if we take the computer , then we have everything , so all you have your heart pressure , your house , your job and you all have a long way up on a regular little bit
it 's called the appointment , einstein 's central ,
these are parts of tiny toxic areas .
the word has already heard , and in a wheelchair it 's always going to show you a horse and
the average little piece of a little bit about three main life and it 's actually makes you the
in our computer in our minds , in our financial crisis , i 've been able to have a chance of six hundred million of
and the light bulb there is getting a little
we 're going to make things , we can make a lot of times of the ancient communication saying , yes , if you can hear how to do it , i can say , can actually , in fact , can actually ,
and more than that , it can
he actually is quite unhappy .
let 's add it to our brain .
our brain has a massive , as a small , as a product , and we have it , and we 've got it in there , and we 've been in a hundred billion neurons , so a hundred
the beautiful one is , our own neurons have not only been able to have the only to go to an disease per disease
and that makes a fantastic pilot , just because it 's beautiful , it 's 10 trillion .
that 's 10 to the mobile steps .
so , in fact , you 've got the complexity of the brain to a much more higher than what we have now been in a while
and if we want to compare the bomb bomb , maybe the one or the other spirit that the first civilizations had to be a free student , heart is the ones that went to the top with the bomb season .
and the other thing that we 've also seen , but the box here is that it takes
and that 's , and that 's what the most of these two big ideas , so they do n't need it , and they 're wonderful and you 're
now if we 're now now larry 's good good part here , at least the great bang , we do n't use the same number with a toy , why do
perhaps , you know , or some of these , or others , this is the web , like the human use is only 10 percent of your brain , are you in this dish to
and then you 'd get a little bit of the advertising a
so , 10 percent is perhaps , but our brains are now living in our evolution of this galaxy that was actually relatively small , in the middle of the middle , even our home with all , everything else has a broken way .
that 's not what we do n't use .
why is it that the world 's greatest part of that is ?
now you know , maybe the term , what about the
i always talks about the lens , and you can see the tea , in the ocean , and then the top is the top , and then the surface comes down .
and this 10 percent in the top , which is that we have the same kind of what our brains , our muscles response , is actually but it 's actually but a huge wave of american ,
we announced the term `` our '' '' we talked to have a minister of what we call `` our ''
and , for a chemist on this memory , maybe it may be the one or other people 's talking about the alphabet
people who were always going to remember many more often than that , when i did n't actually seen the same plane , and they would say , `` oh , '' but then , but , but , but , but , but , but ,
this is where there 's a special , one called an mind , so someone of a toy , and a guy who is in a plane , in a plane , in a plane , and then the most famous thing , it 's not really about , it 's not really , in a way , in a coffee ,
and that 's not something that 's going on here and , and there 's that , no , every single house , every single door , every single student , he saw that he 's got a match in it , he could take back to
where is this going to happen ?
so why ca n't we do this , why ca n't we , well , that the mosquito will be quite close to the muscle times a little more energy in its local percent .
now we 're using this , but why can n't i not have to remember the ted ted night night , in all the details ?
so , in coal , i had an interesting experience with this very
he once worked for example in the 1970s , and he worked with a food system that had found her scientific , and it was n't more of the time the crash was n't happening from the brain , that 's not what the crash was
wonderful , so that came very well to me .
now , here we go , but the way people go to the end
there 's a very clear game at the end of the end , or to the end , if you can not remember the same thing , then the way the driving effect of the car can go back into the car , which is
and in fact , with one of the top the most successful guys was
the second thing i found was great , was he 's got a woman in computer who told her mother 's always in the wild she 's been a little bit , and she was her , like , she was her ,
and that was her sitting on her teacher 's head and her mother was read .
and then he said , `` in palestine , just once the other one .
then they started out , they started out they were four times that happened , she actually had n't read it , now she can do it .
and then they said he said , `` tell me the crash . ''
they actually found an individual version of a gps camera in the background , where exactly on the side of the text , the woman read .
so the brain has this page and it was a prisoner of a kind of a way
and then they could read it .
so yes , we 've actually access to what we 've been doing , but we 're going to say , in normal life , we 're going to say twice what
now , we 're now not to get the idea of what 's been a little bit , but as in fact , a single picture of the picture , we 're going to think about what we 're going to do , and we 're going to think about what we 're going to do , when they 're really comfortable in a black and they
and , it 's now been an early night , put in , you know , in a way , you 're actually going to go out of yourself , `` ha , '' you 're going to have a little bit
and remember a very successful , very successful event in the past past .
take the first one , which is coming .
and if you do that , maybe you might have noticed that you will actually get a visual piece of it .
you might get a picture , maybe a movie , maybe a movie
some of them wo n't even go because we do this , but they do it for the first time .
and if you see that , you can be in the movie , you 're in the movie , out of your eyes , or you can see yourself in a screen .
this is a term for us that we can call this one
thanks a lot , you can think of the thought , people will turn it back to you
who has a visual information , a hand ?
yes , there 's a few hands up here , which is like , `` this is the way , '' so , this is about , it 's about , it 's about , i 'm trying to say it 's about what we expect to do so , that it 's not
well , keep the marketing marketing .
but , sorry , as you can see , if you 're carefully , you 're not just in the details of being able to see that memory , and it 's really beautiful to see , it was beautiful , there 's been a nice thing , that 's beautiful , it 's actually , it 's actually going to be
and now what happened to be fascinating .
and so the way that it was yes , but yes , the brain makes you right in the way that we do n't have any difference between what we actually are , and what we 're doing is we
and also , you can try to do this in a home , if you 're sitting at home and you 're in something that you 're not going to imagine , this is not going to happen to you like this , you 're going to bring things
and , you know , these stories that you 're telling me is to the point of being living in the world at the
back then , there 's the thing , and this is what happens , and that was so beautiful , and the more of the stories that are going to be much more of the stories , the ones , that the day are much more connected , there was a lot of joy , there was a lot of joy , there was still a lot
so if we do that , if we do , we actually change our memories so we can change it , why do n't we go back to the question ,
so , in a nutshell , when i came out , my uncle has shown me a picture of his apartment in switzerland .
a very beautiful image , it 's a very beautiful knee .
only , the image is so beautiful to the bone , so it 's an intellectual freedom , he tells me , because there is a beautiful dog , there is a beautiful dog , there is a beautiful dog , there is the sun on the side of the sun , which is
and why do n't we do this because not with our own memories , our own memories , our own memories , what kind of what i 'm going to do , what i think is more of a lot
they actually have an intellectual freedom in their own imagination .
but you know , you know , you know , you see some people who are in the morning , if you just lose that kind of like a little
i have bad at all right , i went to make all the papers through the head .
and really the whole night and this thought i did n't have to go back
i believe it 's the way he 's going to go to the idea .
the son designer friend of mine came to me rather more than he 'd came to germany because his mom died in seattle and he just did terrible labor .
so what the dad did was he got , he 's got a son with the son , or , has said , `` well , what was the most beautiful thing that happens ?
what was the most beautiful , telling me , and then he told him to let it 's going to tell him , he just tell him what is the same thing .
and , in two weeks , the son was going to exist .
and then it was -- that the way the queen is going to come back to again .
and this is today 's the whole tradition of what 's been on the end of the older people i know today .
so it 's not the basic memories that makes us the things that are we are , but it 's our focus on our way of understanding our focus on the way we 're using
and how much energy energy can use for drugs or use
so if you 're a writer designer thought of designer or say , this is now i 'm now now , that 's the thing , that 's the thing that the problem is , but i do n't really think about it , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
what we do n't know , what we 're looking at is a heart student , and , you know , what 's nice , what 's nice , that 's what i 'm doing , you know , that 's what
and then they 're going to take it to that .
take a look at your job and let 's take the piece of this .
or if you get a ph.d. in a poet , you 'd be able to put your chair , or your wife , or your husband , you 're going to be
so , take it up to this image , you 'll have an extraordinary passion , you 're going to
now , sylvia 's photographer with a toy , and they 're able to see it in the back of the room ,
because they 're also , because they 're funny , that 's what
and you can find a lot better with the situation suddenly .
so , can perfect memories with this ?
no , i think that our brains has to make a lot so much valuable that it can sell
it 's not , but nothing , because we 're able to choose free , how powerful we 're going to focus and how important we 're going to have a conversation , a memory , a thought
my favorite therapist to you , play with the images in your head , you use the power of your head , and you give it every day , your life .
good afternoon .
thanks for coming up .
if i asked a party , what i 'm doing in my talk and i tell you that i 'm going to be doing with a writing of my friends and i 'm going to see a little bit of the eye and see my audience in the head of the audience who 's the
if i 'd admit it to the mountain , to make a piece of music music , then in front of these letters , these were the kind of surprising images of the old people who just seen in just a long time in the morning , and very much
frank 's favorite thing said to speak about music is just like the wisdom i love to talk about
and so , as so , that 's also what we 're doing with .
so with that , you 'll have a little bit of what i 'm talking about today , i 'll give
sebastian betti
it 's actually about being a regular event .
that , i think , is the best part of the moment .
since the time of the time , the fbi system is going to come out of the board of
we 're now going to be our own moment between the ground and the end of the 20th age and up to our youth , which is the incredible force and the joy of
but what we 've also learned is that the expansion of the resistance and the success of us are a little bit of joy , and they can
and we have to realize that the general crisis in the classical music does n't even go to the outside of the content , so that it 's for the music of the
so we 're looking for the question of how to create a square machine that the music is going to go down , the music and the power , that 's what we like to do so much to their
how can we organize a campaign that works beyond the price of the pantheon ?
we 're asking the signals that they know from the classic virus , space , time , light , context ,
let 's take the relationship between the text and the flowers .
normally , between the stage and the audience 's going to turn up .
we 're trying to test the test
here you see a picture of our sample .
the hiv cell , you know , is scary , even in the positions with the audience , right up , play , a few pieces , a two little , and the audience again
the whole one is a little bit more square than the home at
everyone who has the case of surgery , come on the stage and go back .
or you 're sitting in the amazon .
in the typical cortex , it 's like you do to get to more or less , you get to press , as much as you see here , and it looks in and
but there are music , there 's no case , there 's actually no way
and we were thinking about how you could do that .
if you sit different and you can sit in a short piece of music , you 'll hear it differently .
and again , in this valley , we have n't had a stage in this valley , but we had four programs that are
the audience could have a fortune accident .
that 's where the night had ever been in the first row of life
important to us is that we do n't just make any kind of a drone , but we 're the music of the music .
so we 're asking , what are the spaces and the people also also also , but also people have the music that they 're going to be like this , how they 're going
and so in night , at a time in the night of the night , at an end of the night in rwanda , the english time actually be about being used to be
but not just the spaces and the tumor can be alive and the feedback , but the connection with other waste .
and so we 're really happy that we 're working on a few years with the privilege of working with the privilege of the game , we 're working with the time to actually develop the music of the other , or the
and so , for example , then , for instance , then , for instance , then ,
and in that year , we have one , yes , if you like , `` break '' -- ''
we 've had a tumor program with a square device .
we have the history of the soldiers of the architect brothers with a speech , called engineering , and the same time to a square
it was also working , because we had a big , big early job that we put in this piece of time .
we have a lot of money from people from a long bunch of people who could n't put it to the unexpected .
at least this is something that 's made out of a community .
we 're really happy in the lower republic of a home in a home .
the city is exactly exactly as big as big spaces , and we 're very excited about the very amazing places for the kind of things that are so small
when the year in the state of the u.k. two weeks ago , the state of the city in europe in the city , the city is just going to go , it is just going to
the whole thing is going to get its own
we 're sending them an organic set of students and students like autism , the nurses , the bush , the bush , the other ,
and to a chemist , a german device that is like this , or a physicist and a bunch of a tree 's eye , a seven to 10 inches in a square accident that takes a year for a year
in fact , but also , but it also works for a year to point for , for example , that the higgs script or the crash , the crash in being the hands of the people
we 're doing all of that in our games and live in a lot of germany
that means the most part of the work is going to create you and on a zero
only three times in year we spend the year in turn to a local bus , a lot of problems , the one or the other problems that have left , and also the same with the other , the simple matter is the thing that the most scary matter of being able to
and then instead , going to be able to get to a few days or to get to a few days or a few weeks of your hands , and you get to the way where someone 's got to be used by the crash ,
and of course , in the five days , the production tools are
now you might be able to do anything that you would have to have to do with a kind
but our grandchildren is going to continue to continue
we have a big community in oxford a large community around us around around us in what we want to do .
this is from the classic ted talks , but it 's also very much as much as the most powerful , because we have a mouse that is now to face a bread that is now free food to the needs of the cost .
the surgeon is going to be a conversation in the city of the whole year and sell it over the
until there goes to the bomb bomb .
we found a whole series of different regions that we 've been able to put in the living place to give the drugs to come to there
and in this way , this is the ice thing that is very , in this town , and from people in this town .
they 're looking at a very special way of looking at it .
since the past of the year , we were able to call a nuclear support of the local people in the place to call a nuclear bomb in a way that now that they 're
we 're sending from the latest belief that classical music is the same , using the right hands .
and so we 're incredibly happy to say that in fact , in the europe , we 're very happy about this , in europe of young disorders , music music
if you 're still not able to be doing it as well , as the sound of the game of the classic music , you will just get over it .
so the next year we came back to an emergency store , and we 'd be happy if you 're there .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , learn .
you might think maybe , you know ,
now , i know know that you have to learn or be the effect of learning , but i mean , for learning , that is , i think , even more than that
and i think , what happens to be a very beautiful piece of time .
what i learned from art and culture , now , i can tell a lot of a lot of it , because at the same time , i 'm going to do one
and so i 've been thinking that maybe i would probably be able to give this little a little bit of a word that 's a little bit of a thing
art is beautiful , but it 's very much work .
they 're now also now , too .
you always have the laughter , though most of the people know .
why is that ?
i think that 's what the word is the wrong thing , which we ca n't make it right as very simple .
art , which we say , sometimes , is what happens .
and to work , we say we 're doing something that is what
sometimes .
the people who love to work , which is what i was doing .
but at work , we think more than the job and the art itself on the very rich and the very expensive and the natural , where we 're moving in , our experiences , our own thoughts
and so i 've been looking at my own company that i want to share with you now , in about three hours in five years , that all the time have been doing , and i started a little bit about the back
it starts with the crash , for the child , to continue to the study , to the conclusion , to the author , to be not all listening about my youth , not knowing , but then on the other , the word `` the word , '' i 'm going to
the interaction for the first part of my professional life and finally , five , x-ray .
and so close to one of them is that they 're able to know this distance from
it 's an artist place , two and
you learn to it in the first two , three years ago , if you 're doing something , and i 've been doing a
and so with 10 , 11 , i played these little pieces of little , on the dog , not far from here , in the bible .
these are the ones live from a keyboard .
there will be a random chip and the other voice , but it 's very different .
the circle is actually right , but it 's a disaster disaster .
and that , to me , and i wrote , is something in the art that it 's going to work , and if it 's only two voices , you 've been able to think about whether that 's the point of the future , the past , in a
and i learned to have two characters , sometimes three ones , to play in the late campaign , to play , to be able to hear how to hear a computer one .
that was what i learned to be in some other .
another experience i never said , and i 've had a chance to go to it today and maybe that i 'm going to go to
i have a ph.d. , and it was still more people in the room today , and the middle in the 1980s came to me .
i had forgotten .
i played with a television note .
and then came back from the back and the same thing i did n't go to do again
the audience has almost been left almost than me , because i went to my place for my place , my music music , put it out and started the third time a time .
and they do n't believe that the hell that i 've been going to
but that was a very common experience .
maybe it was also one of the experience of what i knew , well , with your dog , i was quickly happy , i could n't be able to go out my way and i would n't be able to write up
yes , the next chapter of my career is in play with the physics and the other i 'd like to share with you the stories
when i was a ph.d. , i went to my apartment and i asked him to play , i would have to play the crash .
and he said , `` yo , that wo n't go .
there must be a lot of volunteers , a lot of experience of women have been done .
now , imagine a little young man , well , young , such an accident .
i did n't forget the one of the time
and from one i found , i 'm more skeptical .
and in the same time , i was in a toy 's toy .
i have been talked , and i remember a situation that i never did .
it was the hardest thing of the royal sex and now coming to the part of the work , i just did n't see it , and it was the most beautiful way to make it , really , really , i 'd had to make a lot of the beautiful
i 'm not going to play now , not a little bit of a person , and i 'm not going to do it
i have been doing this for 20 , 30 times a total of times , and suddenly it
and then i sat on , i got to go and i was in a wheelchair 's , and i just know that i suddenly could get a lot on the ground and keep it on .
i was very much to me .
i had nothing to do with nothing , nothing , and the music did this thing to do with it
i have an experience where i learned to have some really love to learn .
and sometimes it 's also really true to work with , you know , that you put in these financial business care in which i call it to the crash .
where all of you go .
we actually actually had this situation in the ancient 1980s in a organization in the late .
and then almost everything like being anything , when we did the privilege of the election , it took only a little six months where you 'd spend a lot of years ago
now , these are my experience with the dog , with a sense of , i mean , with a
and now i come to my apartment , i 'm a little
i had an adult show when i was a student , but it was an
we 've played with glasses , we 've got a lawyer
i have been a teenager and i would take my job on my own job for music and the crash .
in the green car , with a show of play , a german student , wonderful experiences that i really had to stand in .
and then a point where i went to see a student in the royal theater , where the crash was in the crash and the family and the community , and i was doing this idea with working at the time , and this is a proposal , because of the art of art , of culture , of course , in the late election , to make a job in the
that 's the art , of culture , to make it , to make my own
so here , for the art of art , but not as artists , but otherwise , you would n't say not to do not to stop , but you do n't say , you
i was there in theater and i was in germany , in germany , there was no more case for the crash , only in the theater , and i was in a way that i 'm going to have a question of how you can do to improve art to improve the goods of art
and that was why i also went to go into my classroom , in this particular experiment , and i had a month , and i had to miss a little bit .
but before a different kind of a interview , and this one project , i have , with a
and i went to the barefoot dinner .
the average bush has his vote in the backyard .
i 'm a journalist , although sometimes in my own language , because i was born in a coma , always , the older officer , i 'm sorry , i 'm going to have to miss this .
but i have a journalist , because my little foot were in and also a younger , and i had a journalist , and i had the computer job in coffee
now , that was something that i had to put out of , and suddenly i became a different form of culture in a different form of culture , in a coffee , in a culture that was built by people in this to design of the resistance .
as a result , we had an press on the front of us , all in a very different situation , in
and i 've been working with a journalist , the research minister and an artist journalist , who made my friend and a friend , and it was always for the long brothers , he was playing , i was able to get a different one , i 'm going to have a different thing , for
we 've done the eradication of the ancient election , but of course , on the heart of the german square ,
and this practice , which was really from people .
it was my favorite computer , that i was going to spend a lot of time and i was n't going to do not know the wall was .
i was on the next day in my day , i had an general theater , i knew the wall is like ,
i 've been going to wait with some questions on the board side ,
and then we have been undercover for the cities to the cities in the east
and i 've been thinking about how stars like insects are going to be like living to two two
in fact , we 're talking about the same language that music will be in there wonderful and has been wonderful , but lots of a sudden
unlike the bomb people were n't given me from the people , but it was a lot of the top , and that was a lot of the way , and i was looking at a big , like , i got a lot of time going back to a time called
and then in the time , germany has
in the time , it 's a lot more square than there is
so , by a way , i have learned all the things in the same way and the city ,
we had a ph.d. that i had a mathematician , and i was in a toy , and i would like to do this one , when i started here , i started in my career 's head
i still have .
and in particular , it was for a lot of time , and they did n't want
i was the first director of the resistance .
so i did n't really have that kind of thing before , and i was really wonderful that i was going to have a very wonderful job , but they 're going to go on it , because i could put it to education
we 've been doing a lot of the urban field , and we 've just got this kind of competition between a kind of a coffee and a writer and a film , and what we 've discovered there , the abstract experience , `` design '' where you can talk about interaction between design and architecture
many , many , many of the connections we could and i was able to do it and i have a point , and i figured out what that means , if different people are
what you notice in the process of the fact is that i 'm always more of more more more than a culture that is going to be the way that we have the most of the people 's relationship with the living , the way between the energy , the better ones , and
and by the way , between the way , it was the way between the way in between the way that the problem was , as we were , in fact , seven an case , at
but that last chapter , this fifth device , he did the memory of it .
this word has two main rights , to one , and i 'm doing to something so i can use it , and i can also use it as an architect , and i can say , i 'm using something that means that i know something
and it 's always in its backyard .
i know something with his life , like , i 'm going to put you or the or i can use this
and i 'm doing to myself when i was to a journalist and say , `` i 'm sorry with me with what i want to do .
and that 's a really big job .
five hundred million people are trying to move , to move , to transform a living cities , to see what they can do in the same way , to the extent that they can make
big , we 've been able to call this word , but even as a community of a lot of people who live in a big plane and at least one particular language , even though the world 's nations are here , and this was our belief to treat the face of the
on the heart hand , at the time of the highway , many other experiences
and i have n't seen a experience out of the month .
there 's an italian opera , and eat , two schools , and , you know , two schools , and you 've got a baby video , and young students out of a school school , from a way to a very happy of a lot of art , which
and it was a remarkable effect that young girls had a parent of young and young , they were talking to the fellow of young men from germany in a little bit of
and there was one of these young men who had to put up the boat and was able to get this dog
and , in fact , he would say from a letter and said , `` i 'm a student , '' he wrote him home when young baby he was playing him , and i ca n't play a plane , because my two fingers are playing
and he was sending his finger with a board , and he went back to the piano in this game at an israeli newspaper and trying to play the crash
and it did n't end it .
it was such an ideal painting for me to be a kind of a magician , and i said , `` oh what we learned , what
we 've learned that many people can move together to make a difference , but in all of the things we learned that we were going to have to live in the brain years of peace and culture in the world of the process we were n't even on , because we 're going to have to talk about what
and that was a wonderful experience , and you see it 's not just about knowledge .
it always always works to what it is to be something with , and to win it
and if we 're doing a lot of fear and writing what we 've been doing , we 're going to try to take ourselves out of art and culture , our own position in the same with the process of using the process of information , by the way we 're going to do with art and
and i hope you 'll have a lot of time and a lot of them to take this little one .
thanks a lot .
yes , thanks a lot .
i think we wait to the first picture .
so i have to conclude to support the support of my senses here a few slides .
but it 's not just scientific computer , but it 's really in my career here , and i 'm going to go up with a point of what i think we 're going to do is really going to be really
so , through the conventional words , i 'm now going to end up for what ted does , and i think in the area of coffee , we can be able to turn
and then i 've heard that you should be able to think about your own talk in english if somehow it could do , but if you look at it , you would n't understand what i wanted to say to english , i did n't really understand what i should say , and so i 'm going to talk
as we die .
i have to tell you about this first first .
and fortunately , patient was in the hospital where i won the election election , and i was thrilled .
she was always in the '60s 's december years old , and she always always like in the same of the may dance , because she was also on her husband that the first man had ever been
and so every year , they go to the nearest place , and they had long , and they may now have a writing accident , and then they got it in and it turns out , here on the right side , that the leg
a few years before , she had been noticed and had a whole way , to have a deal with the same piece , and yet the left leg .
and at the time , i was also in the old days as a doctor , and you know how you were a kid in the financial crisis , how you were a kid with a local degree , and you 've been going to have been used with the
does it ever make sense to a new degree of such a strange design for making it ?
so the way is , in the financial age , the most successful child , is this one of the
and she 's been blessed .
five years later , i come to the hospital , see the name , and i can feel good about it , because it 's just so rare , it 's just going back time , and it 's just going to dance
so the question is , what am i going to do when i talk about how to decide , what would i do for a human being , what he 's going to do in his name or what he could
and that 's a little bit of the theme of the puzzle process
you see here the crash the crash , the way we die .
it 's a book from titian , as we 're working on the end of the report .
and then it was that , in the back , globalization was very active so that , you know , you 'd ask to work , you 'd be able to work with
you have to , and you can now even read this book , but if you say it 's going to have a health effect , it 's going to go back there
it will take an extension of work for the work , and it will also be a lot more efficient than that , for example , in china , that was a huge
and so that 's what happened , in the case of the individual , is a little bit surprising , something that is , in fact , a little bit of the fact , that it 's always getting increasingly in the quality of the quality that he 's
and that , after my favorite favorite , people just always pay less and more part of their work , and more and more of a small , a little boat , where they were doing , they were doing the great wave of the great , and they were n't more interested in
and if we zoom on the board and medical medical space , there is exactly one that is really an design .
if you hear it in the tv , what doctors , they 're talking to the doctors , their clothes , and also , most of the
and that does n't mean anything else , when there must be a muscle thing to be able to get it for , and if not she does n't even go , then the medical action of the medical work also also , it also says , or
and through this kind of analysis , but the work of the debate are increasingly more and more and more and more of the time that you can actually have its work in it and have it using some personal concepts , in the background of the background
a good friend of mine , after a great friend , is that the only way he wanted to do this was a fantastic designer , which i had to go and is to be a minister for the meeting of the day
the economist are in this field as a result , and he 's a writer , had an idea that always more and more older people are living around the game , in school , and back by because the fbi never knew what they should do when they were
and then you come to the hospital , you 're going to turn back to the store , you go back to the store ,
and this one , in fact , was thought when there was something wrong in a microscope , i want to give you a little bit of a little bit here , which you can see from this cycle of the detector and also also be a more old wave
there he did , in general bin he had the language to figure out with the language , which was exactly exactly the same thing that happened in this dish .
it will also be used to have a population system in the
it 's not more the high ones that are sure , but you get it in a very position , i want to be not a store for the next , or not to the hospital , when i 'm
and then the big bang becomes .
in argentina , it 's like a conversation with a time to the design self , and you have to imagine , i want to go into the hospital , or i do n't want to get a hospital to the hospital if
that 's exactly how to call a living with a place or i do n't want to go
this data goes to a third center and there 's sitting in this doctor for cuba , and the u.n. has always been able to go and then the decision on this
now if we go to a coffee station , which , like in terms of war , and also it was a whole bit of a mouse , and we would n't be able to go out and have the second dance , and you would have to see that you can see where you 're going to
and the scene of my friend right now that 's in the wheelchair also very much more than the way he wants to do with this
in the last part of the past , today today is now going to die to the number of people who are not going to die at home , but in the hospitals , in the classroom , and that the world of the world 's , it 's often , it 's often , it 's often , it 's often
there are also in the way , which is that very well , there are very , very older people who are going to get there to the place , but when i give myself the luxury , and we 're about to be about five patients in the year , and i would say , i would say , it 's hard to
and the whole thing of course , of course , is clear , that is really clear , that this whole religion is actually just in fact , because in the last way , it 's not going to be able to say that all people who are going to be able to say , the medical health system , that they say , because i can be fine
now that 's just the reality now , you need two degrees of the back and the other , and most of the time it 's just just
this advice of the food system as a result of all over the growing market that you want to protect , which is , it 's also on
and now i 'm going to show you how to get a little bit of a little bit so , so what we 're doing now is , i 'm in the last one last questions , because i have a real questions ,
and i just , just to get a writer and the daughter of me over there , because i think , a society would have as much as the structure , as well , and also the same structure that we 've all been in the same
and in the meantime of a paper , he just shows that the people would be more
and the second one is there , she 's going to protect a long-term job of all .
and what i sometimes sometimes is one third sentence in there , that each one of the one that has to have is the voice to protect and to invest .
because the one way to get itself out of the way , you know , is to clean a water out of this thing , and i 'm going to give you a little bit of the way and i 'm going to have to get some of the
because the last thing is , if we do n't like this issue , we 're going to get back to the point of the moment .
hopefully late , with 100 or a half .
that 's what i 'm talking about , which is , of course , to say , i mean , and i want to worry for them , but in a way , you have to ask the issue , and if you 're going to have a moment of time , or , you know , if you 're a student , you can be in your way to
now if you think about what makes it , what makes it , then , you go to the dots where the last thing you 're going to go to do is , you 're going to have the five
there is a book which is pretty close to a very short tradition .
it 's the kind of intellectual characteristics , and it 's the friends that i have , that i can love with , and i can see the skills that i know , and the ones that are in the life of life
it 's safe to be able to be able to do so in the game or in the lower area or a bicycle or a piece of other people to meet in the relationship .
and it 's out there in many of these examples of life that i 'd like to say , i 'm not all going
but if you look at these three points for a lot of time , you have a whole lot of time , you might have to change it in life like that , in the last way that it has to protect
and then again , we 'll be able to do another more factor , which is to experience a certain degree of the recovery , i just had this one , like text or than as an
other people can be able to give us all the decisions and the behavior that 's being there , not
that 's my inner faith .
we can get out of ourselves out of ourselves .
so it 's not the question of what 's going to do , because it 's going to be some of me , who are going to be able to protect , do , you know , or
but it 's exactly to ask where i 'm going to be in people where i can actually take on my own and i would get my way to the place that i can be able to the questions and i can get some more
and if you say how we 're working , this one of those grains of tools that became being sold to look at outside is a way to say , i 'm going to try to get a way of my being a way of being able to
because no one can be true , as i 'm concerned , and the other person i can see
and i have to do not have a member of general magazine or anything that i can say you have to do a face and because you 're so old , if you 're going to be honest , you want to be able to
and so the questions that i can do in the last few months of that is probably some
this would be a map of the people in me , and the fact that it can not be able to protect the state of the state of the state of law , of course , of law , and to me and i can get some more , if i
and to do these jobs , you need a little bit , and i think , and i 've been able to do this talk , and here , i 've been able to do a little bit of a picture of the way , and i 've been able to see a little bit about the
so with that , if we 're old , you can say , oh , that a dance dance can be in may , despite me very high , high career , which would even be .
thank you for listening for your attention .
good evening .
i 'll spend two things .
if you 're the first part of your head , you 're going to have a little
it 's another second .
let 's start with a coffee .
that 's not nuts , it 's not .
what do you mean ?
are there different ?
or is it failed ?
yeah .
this is not good , if you 're a one of one that 's what you 're
so , in fact , but i needed it , for the who you know .
that 's not what we do .
we 're just moving up with one single thing .
and i 'd like to call a little bit of a ship .
and , in addition , a lot of times , we know a little bit of
and it 's for the advertising for a corporation to map of different
if we 're in the back of the day , and we have two main favorite cups in which one of the instance of the street
we know , we know , we 're going to go out into the box that 's small , and it 's actually three and it 's three people .
we can , if we can , if , in any cases , if we can get the
are we going to do it ?
that means we 'd only been a writer , a , two , three , we 'll be in the three , we 're going to be the ones , when you look , three houses , one , two , three , three , three three three
that 's what i mean , yes ?
very nice .
this works the great thing that works in a big numbers , although it 's a really , really
but it does it happen .
how do you even figure it ?
how do you get to have some more likely to have a lot of people like facebook
i 've known to be friends and people and not like anyone else .
let me go .
it 's called the computer !
you 're all right now , you know , that 's sure , right now , we 're in the morning , and we 're
not , that 's nice .
so , you call it as an artist age , and it does it work , right ?
you take one , you put it on a chair , your mouse .
the next chapter , the next square things , the next thing we can make , and all of a different people are going to get different , no legs , and the big one
now we 're going to go back into
how can we bring two a dozen thousand ?
we would say that one is as large or less than the other .
we could do it ?
we would start started back .
right , that 's wrong , because the point is that if you start to power in a more short long way , i would just say you 're not going to have to get it out .
henry , more times , is sure , huh ?
so , how are we ?
tumor ?
it 's impossible , yuck !
she had exactly it in real time .
court !
so , now let 's look at this in a moment .
do you want it 's bad times , right ?
you see , you see , you see it , you know ?
the point here is what 's really doing it .
if i take the interface to take a map of numbers , a lot of the things that we do n't like to get the first zero at the beginning , zero , one ,
and we would say , we 'd be going to take a copy of this , and we 're going to take this guy out of
left you just pay , okay , hey , two , four , six , eight , huh ?
okay ?
all right numbers are really square to the most recent survey of the natural numbers , but on one of the clouds , you ca n't have the one that 's coming up on the other one ,
now let 's call a lot of chocolate feedback from the side , and we can see the other amount of representation
what do you think ?
is scary powerful , is it bigger than it is actually , a large or a small
morton bast ?
but that 's very , very frightening , yeah , in that one is a bad one ,
who 's got a different choice ?
smaller ?
who is going to be bigger
ah , who really really really have a plan , yes ?
now that can be not be , yes ?
you can not , where do n't have the good , bigger , this is n't going to be a
okay , so you say to be less
would you do it ?
this is the most most famous thing that you can expect , of course ,
and now now , i 'm going to talk about why the most majority of
how does it work ?
right .
yes , we do .
that 's the point .
we teach .
we take the zero amount of time , we take the zero from the natural lot , to the ones , to see it
the next one i 'm going to give you about , after , two of them , after two , two , one , after the zero
the four , the two , who are six , who are the eight , they 're four .
you can also do this , then it will work in the other direction of the time , that
and it 's obvious to be , through the device , what i 'm doing is , i 'm always going to try to get this into the
and here one , there 's just the head on the side , and the camera is just for a long
we 've sent the natural natural field on the side , and the hip is the way that the camera is , and the bus
that 's just the only thing .
so if you explain to some of the things that we 've learned today , yes , is what 's more of a sudden , i just say it 's
a lot of a sudden a lot of a sudden is a , in the conversation , which is actually not , and that is the sound of the brain , is an actual bone
you do n't create it in the back you 're going to be by three three people , but only one up and before , that was three .
yes , so that 's what we 've been doing
is n't any honest ?
okay .
we 're going to do another , second part , which is
the lines , most of them needs .
so here 's what a show .
so , in this experiment , i 'm sure i 'm going to have to know a third one , and i asked someone to it , and i put
so , let 's call the radio , b , c .
i have been watching , i hope , you have n't heard it .
and they 're now going to guess good .
where do you mean , i 'm going to put anything up , i 'm going to put a
well , guess what , our coffee language , here .
they 're suffering .
who has another idea with that ?
a single one ?
who has an idea ?
seriously , henry , b has a common , not , otherwise does n't hear it , huh ?
that 's right .
it 's really completely impossible , so you do n't have to get my mind back the three letters and i 'm going to go
it 's really really really , yes ?
it 's really clear , because the chance that the opportunity that they are most lucky is , that only is only a third .
so , henry , there are three things , it 's really really , yes ?
now i 'm doing , i just do one in .
well , i know where it is .
so , the other thing , that 's what somebody who 's
so , i know where it is , and the best and the good and the good and the people , or whatever you call it , it 's going to be
so i 'm really , i 'm actually , i 'm actually , i 'm going to
so it 's like we 're going to step in a second game .
now , hey , i 'm on the one , i 'm clapping .
so , i need to show a door behind the end of it , and they did n't tell it .
because , if you say to god , i say , and i know , it 's not like god .
then there was no second step .
then i say , `` solomon , '' a mouse , no way .
but i have to say , this is ready , in the second game .
so i can only have a fan behind it not not only , but she does n't have said .
now the question , and this is the most important chance , under the ground here , under the ground , that is being open , and it 's not that , you have to guess your last needs to guess in .
now , you 'll be ready to a good now , but i 'll be a
i 'm going to do this at what they want .
or they say , i do b .
now the irony is , is it on the knowledge of this ?
the pro-ana department , which is , is that , b is on , so i know it 's my
or , god , thank you , god open , i always wanted to stay in a place , that 's it .
or if you say , well , it 's kind of marketing , we have , kind of , kind of , you know , we only have two windows , now it 's not safe to change
what do you mean ?
it 's not enough .
somi .
why is n't it not ?
very nice .
why is it that it 's worth ?
yes , exactly , that 's wrong .
and that happens to be almost when you had to see it yesterday , in the day
but that 's how they are , as a , very , very fun , a
so , the thing that is really , really , is really .
now , we know that all of the things that i do n't know , six and , yes , i ca n't go back to the last few years , i
so , it really does .
behind this door , it 's really about a third .
and it 's always just a third behind a door .
you can know what they want , they have two thirds of it in the stream .
that means , you could know in a single way , you do n't know , you do n't know , you 're in a toy , you can get on two dozen , and you 're in a , more , more , more , if you 're in the english , it 's
but here we only have a dance .
so , now , this is , two third of a city is not what you believe .
so the two third city here , but it can only be behind a door .
behind the bottom .
so what about more effort ?
i 'm sorry i 'm really going to get up
so what will be more likely to do ?
it 's better to stay or to change or to change ?
now it 's easy , yes ?
yes , of course , that
so , that 's not really hard , huh ?
ha ha .
what do you see ?
they 've been happy .
why ?
it 's very simple , but , like , two thirds of a sudden are a hundred percent : the
i hope it was for everybody to do it .
thanks a lot .
mr. bush , they 're talking to me about `` la , '' for me to say , `` the way to mr. partner '' who is just going to eat and poor food
but i 'm on the best part of the best thing that the time has gone away from all this
i 'll come to the fact i 'd come to this gentleman and i knew 12 when i was 12
that 's what happened to do , right now .
yeah .
so , thanks to the next time today .
i grew up near the nest .
and i do n't know if mr. had come to come to me and ask me if i wanted to take a ted at ted to the lake and a little bit of today .
i 've been an undercover journalist : the subject to trust .
sure , it 's not bad , and i 'm not really worried of the woman i 'm going to mention , that would be the one of the one or the
i 'm going to have to have a full of
so , in the morning , i 'm still going to go back to the car , so now to get a job in it , but i have to get a parent in this , in three weeks , because i want to take in three weeks of the most famous family ,
and in fact , in my case , i do n't get rid
so who got to say , `` you 're going to get married , '' tomorrow , i 'm going to tell you a lot
i 've been told , right now , i 'm a journalist player on the subject of the talk .
and i started , in the beginning , got together with the subject .
no worry to worry about , like , nice , little , blind , the blind trust
i asked myself some idea to me , when i was an actor , how would i i been the best i was going to be
so , i come from a little village with six million , a lot of coffee , some of the time in the kitchen , and my parents on the street are apple x , and i do n't know , and they
trust , of course , in sports , of course , not in the wake , but with me
why is the story i 'm going to go and see ?
for me , one of the most important things i really is looking at is the country from the country and there are two great moments with the oldest brother , the crash .
and with the second age , the same word as i am .
it 's the way , and it 's very , very , very smooth and dark , and that may be able to see where i 'm going to see , where
now what happens is that it 's very much for the
the ones , or we can just see anything something like this .
so coal islands , but i 'm always saying i ca n't see it , and i 'm not going to
the old men , henry .
it 's all over the way up
and what i 'm always most of most of the most is the fact that , of course , is the fact that how you want to trust and you just saw this big trust , this device that we all need to get , more than
and it was my parents that , for my parents , they were like many of you , my brother , and i did n't have a blind
we were so the first ones that actually has been suddenly in their life .
and then they had to do something like this .
and now , now i 'm going to talk about it 's a very lucky fact that my parents were going to have a lot of time to get to us and to say to you , or to say to you , to be in the hand of the hand , to say that there 's a holy wall ,
a -- that would be done -- we 've got home for this .
and b are calling our parents from the beginning to try to get around it , to go and to the other , but the other
so , in the home of the house , the light is down and the bush , the other thing
and then the guy 's saying , `` i 'm going to put '' at the guy of the
the results that i 've come to do with today .
this is the big death -- these are n't just good for you , but it also is for the surgery .
and our brothers and my brothers and i just put out on a lower farm , just from what was going on in the outside of what was actually doing , especially in the same way that
and that 's where the christmas brother started started with , with three years ago and then , we wanted to do also , and
and then finally , with a child 's , as long as many little children , today , the fbi age `` the late age . ''
and then as the indus script , this
but we 've also started talking to oxford , at least .
and then the big question is : how do you feed the big ?
and as you get to trust the trust , the teacher , the parent , that the children who are going back to the french and have the right to the trust of us we do n't have any more sophisticated
and our solution was that , of course , one of our parents , we have a parent , where to say , where a car where you are going to have a very , very surprising things , that you 're going to have to get
and we had to get around , to get to the one , to the one one , but
and you can not all the test , because otherwise , you 'll not be able to say this is not going to be anything more of it .
but in the end of the day , if you look at the light , and you can actually put the money inside the time , you
can you try and just a child 's license , your blood 's blood , and you 'll find that with all the people in the world , they 'll be able to hear an magic .
so , as the bats are in the same way that the bats will hear , they 're listening to the same , and the wall , an amazing
and that 's what i call in the human mind , and you can also do it in the movement , always
but for the most time , we have high and a high weapon of artists , and the problem is , i have a very good
and i 'm just going to be able to do a lot of the problem and , and i 'm sure a lot of the things that
now i 'm not going to have some of the pictures that i 've been , i 'm very concerned about , which i 'm very comfortable
that 's when we 're building from the living on the lower building
i wrote up here : the food system , it grows with an infinite diversity .
and that 's what i 've been doing in a very simple way , because i 've been in the opera and a lot of times a lot later later in the morning and in the 1930s with trust on the scientific side , and i never say , `` i never have been such like
now that never would n't read , as you can read , was
but also , it also has to be able to do that , of course , it 's not like that
and so , diversity is the information of our brain ability to figure up with a way to know where i 'm so good now , which i have in and where i 'm looking at my
and our brother would come back , who has a baby and me go on to clean radio .
so then , then , then , we 're going to go through a plane
there you can see out there somewhere from the board board for example .
and the end of the night then , i went back , michael after i was probably now , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
but then the final thing about : who 's going to
i do n't .
and i 'm also looking at the other people , we 're the generation of young women , not either .
and from that point , i 'm always going to go .
and then it was the discovery that , in fact , we were all three of the three stages in front of the time , and the father with the senior brothers with the piano was n't actually not know what
because trust is , of course , then you can see when other
so if the father said , i would say , `` it 's a way to help to help , help , help , to help , but to the extent of the danger , a great thing that one of us who have been to feel afraid and had been able
but it never happened .
he had to get a lot to go to a lot as it was to have a little bit more of it , or in a way , or what
and that was really great to me that we had these opportunity .
but sure , no matter , this is n't an privilege of being not trying to make a break .
for me , the different family who were always important in my life , everyone , of course .
and most of all , they were all depressed because i could see , where did i have my study in what it might be like , i 'm going to do it
so , too great , i could never have never been able to
and i never had the privilege .
and i 'm not going to go to the next day today .
i 'm going to go back to that in a minute .
now not at five degrees like the moment .
and at ideo , in german animation -- but still it even as a
but i always went to my brain to find a different bottle of my brain , and i 've always try to try with different waves
the first one , for example .
and that was pretty beautiful to me because there was a parent who , who had us in the 1970s , said , `` ok , we have more powerful than children and iran '' to us some young children .
in fact , it 's good , because there are a lot of one that you get to
and then you see , you see , what the other power does
and there was always my big trust , of course , if i get to get the stage long time , because it might be able to do the other , but even what i do n't want to do .
so , there 's just one way , and that 's the trust of mind .
the other one is a foot in the game of the game , in my own space , i 'm going to go through the plane and then the crash is over , and the museum is over , because
i 'm not going to try this here right
i used to work it , but i had some
i 'm looking at this , it 's now just a little bit
and that 's the case i should have any cell cell , right ?
somi .
`` i 'm a priest '' right now .
okay .
the next thing i was important for was more important than a farmer in school in school would be the crash
my parents were home or are now for the time to the age of the day that they have , and
but to me , in the school , i was really sure , ok , how can i move a lot more after school ? i mean , i could move to
and i had a chance to be able to make a way in school .
and although i was always thinking , this is all true boring , because it 's really an infinite thing to do this , which is more , it 's
and i used to do that in a while . i do n't think
i then then i said , well , i 'm going to the coffee .
and then in particular case , human people , again , again , that 's the most powerful diversity in here , because you need to have an brain one , you need to power , you need good , and it
journalist -- you 've probably seen a lot of your work in your work
that 's the marketing as well .
you just get fast when you 're in the same way that you 're in your own technology .
if you make the trust people in the own power -- the force , you can also be able to be able to be able to be able to go back bad weather , bad weather , to the extent , to the emergency
and if you even even in my case , it 's also the same team in
because as a chemist , which does nothing , i 'm , of course , dear susie
and i 'm never not going to see this guy today -- i have to use the word -- my goodness -- there was only one -- today today has done my practice .
but if you do n't , we 're doing it again .
i 'll just give you a little bit of time .
with one , one one , one one of them , they 're still using another other
what i 've always done is , i 'm always going to trust the issue of the issue that the audience will hold , the audience , the audience , the audience , the audience , the audience , the audience , the audience ,
when you 're in the bush , it 's like you 've got two in your
this one of the things : clear , i do n't have a hand to the point , i could be my head , i would take my job
do n't go .
so i have to help myself differently .
i then went to my apartment to get it down to me .
and the answer is the voice to go .
so , it has to do always a lot of fun
and again , that 's important for trust .
so the notes in the communication system , i think , in the
and the irony says to me always be more , if the crash is going to go back to me and say , `` on the end of the day , '' and then i know it 's easy to the left , so i 'm on the top part of the
if he says , `` at 10 , left to the left , '' right at 10 .
okay , so , everybody understood ?
then the problem of the thing , then i have to say , i have to say a little bit about it again , and i 'm going to be back again
and to me , this is completely big , important if the crash goes to me , i have to really completely completely able to say a little bit about it .
to make sense , he 's for me the tools that i could , really to be able to be quickly , i 'm actually going to be on it -- quickly , in the case of the same system
and i just , just if i do , i just want to figure out with both of the players to me , me me , to sit on a leg , and i 'm really going to make the eyes and make you 're going to have the eyes , i
and then , just like this , it 's going to be so stupid and then to get into the other side of the skin and just on it and have some sort
also with high hands .
yes , and that 's really important for me to say , when i 'm doing this , i 'm like , i 'm not going to say , i 'm going to say , because i was just men in the way that i was going to say , i 'm going to say , `` you know , you have to make the right
so the answer is not what he must say to me .
so i 'm out to open the way of communication .
and that 's what we call in every tv game
if someone does n't know my person , he ca n't help me , but i 'm not asked to say , `` well , i 'm going to be doing a lot of time , maybe i 'll just get
or i need to be the same person from you and the school that you also tell me the same way as long as the mountain is because if we put the word , you think , you think , you know , you have to think it 's going
and again , as a chemist , and the thing is just listening to the point
and i also , you know , i 've been able to do the computer thing as the student 's going on , on a giant plane , and i say it 's only 10 minutes behind us , because we were -- we were going to do a more old minutes , and it 's
and of course , that 's important for me , because i think it 's the case to have an effective
i 'm saying , `` the way to you say , is there other people who can go to
who gets more ?
so my best time was , a faster time , and this was in the hospital , and now on the bus , i may never never even even on the same thing as a storyteller
and in the meantime , they have an amazing rate .
and for me , as i said , these are the details of being able to figure if i just open my ears .
the other one i also wanted to explain to you about what he looks like to see , and i have the opportunity to predict my risks
and that 's one of the important things i want to say : trust is , you know , it 's more training , not the
so , it 's not like the blind right now , frankly -- from the buddha .
because i also had the experience that i had a confession on the left and the left part of the same
and then this happened in the back , because it was on the walk of the walk for three feet .
and i just like to do three meters .
of course , as i said , that was then at the time -- of course
i know that 's because the marketing people must have come out and must have an ad disaster .
and i 'm going to find it today today , so that i would say , `` well , '' and then , `` ooh ,
so , it was , unfortunately , yes .
it does n't matter as much as it is .
but sure in an abstract situation with pressure , which you probably know is the same thing , and the students are always going to be fast .
then , of course , surprisingly , i 'm afraid , of course
but to me , like i said , `` the way that means the word of the people who have to trust
and i have to say , i 'm in a moment that i 'm somebody who not see , especially , in fact , in a particular way , because i 'm a
so , in the meantime , i 'm pretty much everybody at the
from a nutshell of los tree , from the fall down , the fall down the fall , i 'm going to be a journalist , but of course -- and that 's the important thing -- i
but that 's what it 's going to be in as if the trust is in there
and if you found somebody who was actually a hundred percent as well , i do n't need to .
and i was also interested in the same way as well .
because that 's what 's really important about me , it 's really , really important to
you need the same goal , and i really do , really , really , what does it mean , does it really , who
because that is , often , fast , faster , faster , it used .
i guess it or myself .
but that 's really important , it 's also true , that it 's also a
you know , that you would be a lot of a good
and that , if we were to put them all with a fantastic , wonderful 's famous -- we want to see a way to
and the sense of this is , in fact , that we also create some other , in the end of the mind
that we can create -- in my case , for example , that we have a few of them , weeks of the day , i went to
and i 'm like , `` i 'm now i have to take a point to you , '' or i can trust it in case that i just can just be able to put this
and how do you do that , you know , you 've got to get some time on the mountain
well , of course , i was also , of course , with the most successful reasons , i did n't see some things that if you were to a hundred
then i was pretty comfortable at that .
can be an advantage , then fear is not a problem .
and i still worked on the fear , now now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , the day of the day , i 'm going to be coming from the plane , and i 've got this
now , that 's a little bit of a while when you 're sitting there and you hear the cars , you 're not going to see it even a lot , you have to know it , and i 'm going to get
and these things are always made me interesting .
sure , to know the marketing bomb , but also to know , i 'm going to be war at the end of the day , i 'm going to focus on the way that i 'm going to focus on , i 'm
and that 's exactly the most successful times playing in front of the ancient , because at a blank mountain , it 's like , every day of 10 hours , you 're going to get
you go and go , and only it 's just smoke around , you know , you 're going
you take the barefoot opera , with the former minister of the first war at the top of the
so if you see an apple account , the self is about the last one that the crash .
and that 's what the only exciting happened happened .
we just saw the industry out of the nest , or the other people .
from this morning , i 've been there to be a huge person in the season -- despite his very strange designer who had his
because i thought to myself , well i thought , well , as i said , i 'm probably going to go faster up until the thing i 've been doing
but as i said , it 's pretty , very stupid , because you 're not going to go to a muscle time , actually ,
and really exciting will it be difficult , if it becomes a little bit difficult
so if you go into the corner and the air drops down .
or if it 's next to a piece of a button , if you 're going to have a little bit of a little
and then it 's particularly beautiful , and if it 's still in night and all with your fellow , it 's very well -- but if he said , he would say me , i 'm going to take a little bit of the eye , so i really
because i had a only one without one without one , and that was to be done sometimes to me
and so trust , we have a picture of what i said , well , i can say , of course , i can say , of course , my friend , who was a hundred percent of the people who was , i 'd
but i also need as a very , very compelling form of security , so i do n't have to focus on the issue of the security , because can you imagine if you go to the mountain room on the mountain , the right on
you get ta have a little bit of a word , and
so , for us , we 're all in case , we 're looking for a window of a boat , so we 're actually going up with a window on their high high sites that i had in my hand and then behind her
in the other old season , i have a little bit more the top of the five ever ever ever done .
and she 's only one that only has come to a foot , and she 's just going to see you 're actually playing a foot with her dinner , and he 's actually known to her , i also knew what was going on
and what i really showed out here is how beautiful it is , in fact , that it 's really true when you find the top of it before , because the dark slowly you really did n't have to go back to that it and it 's really like
but it 's also because i realized to have , that i realized , i 've been told that i 've been saying that it 's just the only thing that if i 'm really passionate , i 'm really passionate at the end of
it also makes you the trust of others to be able to work the way that trust the rules
when we were at the end of the mountain , we were in the back of the group of the world 's top , and we were looking at the other seven boys , and they were all about , and i thought , `` well , you know , what are people doing because they 're all that
at the end of the day , you can not see the english
that 's not the reason , in fact .
and then i started to see , `` yes , yeah , sure that the trust in their ability have been pretty depressed in the same way .
you 're going to go through the dark and you 're going to go to 12 o'clock , did n't have a light
this is completely nuts if you 're a student , and the air will be dark , so it 's actually just more even even more now , and
and then , in some way , the moment that one would say , `` you know , that was actually completely going to go to the end of the friend , because the friend of mine has been to explain me everything , we 've been constantly depressed for the women
the whole night was told us about a little bit about the other night , and the other people in the group had exactly exactly that as the nervous , the driver , the question , the question , the question , the more
or i 'm not really told you to the top of it .
and that 's exactly what you know , and it 's not somebody who might just be bad at all that you might be very bad about it , maybe it 's just that it 's just like -- it 's only
and these things that also can be used to be in the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside , and can make it even the way that you
and to me , it 's because of the things that 's happening , but it 's not like that , in fact , that 's perfect when the personal gold gold and what 's really going to do , it 's actually
now , of course , of course , in the prison with the gold system -- i actually actually not do this , why the computer of the music is -- maybe i do n't know , i do n't know to see it 's worth , or could it
so i 'm looking at some of the things that 's been , in front of the car , i 'm
if all of this real happened happened , i did n't really expect me here , i would be on the brakes , i 'm
or at least in thailand , german disaster .
but as i said , i 'm going to start this right , and as you say , the real thing that you can do is more of you to imagine what i 've been doing , what i really been doing , and i 'm
as i said , i went in my ability to my ability , but of course , in the team that we have to all , whether in school , in the case that it was
whether old man or young woman , we just have people in the world that we can trust .
and if we 're in the head of this goal in this case , in front of you , and that have done , the best evidence we 've been able to trust in a project in our lives
and if you can , if you can , you can also be in other areas .
thanks with that .
a science for me , which is the title of my talk , which is the end of the beautiful of the beautiful
what i 'm doing is that the world 's highly passionate connection , the research , is a little bit in the real population of the
basically , i could be happy .
if i have a 3d species , all the way is to work , only , to the end of the scientific issues that i
even every single person has been able to write a whole range of a poet 's random attack , leo , to get out of the scientific issues ,
every `` star '' '' has a square sentence , where somehow scientific work will be
and even if you look at what 's going on in terms of schools and the way that children are doing for the children with the
each of the show of each of each of these things have a sort of a own camera in the word of the
science is one of the things that i love to do , i love to do , but that 's not what i 'm going to do .
cool , so cool is just a way in terms of physical , with the same hand , somewhere that are the most abstract cool , huh
so much , if you do n't , like , a $ five minutes , nothing with the reality , but that 's cool , right
there i can figure out .
and i can just be able to hear a big , very big , i can say , i understand the most abstract
that 's extremely fantastic .
because that 's kind of a bit of a paradox that the future will only be able to solve with such a technical problem and a
but at the same time , it 's not a matter of
i have a few little examples of how science or science are now to us with such a way .
a very classic example : in london , you built a beautiful in the middle of the land , and you can see the word , the word , the god , the god ,
what happens is , now right now , the sun 's ocean open up in this hole , i 've been able to get an interactive device , and then on the other side of the other level ,
it was great , and then it was a little bit of a fire , unfortunately
and so , in fact , the heat of the audience has been so close that this poor was not a long time for long , long , long .
there are you , as a word to say , not just as a little bit of what kind of physics , because i mean , it 's completely new , it 's actually a kind of a brain way .
so , what i found was a new , is an actor , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , like a quarter of wine
i 'm really asking myself , what is more design or god or where he was in the future ?
now this is a really abstract example .
a monkey , which of the process of this life , is also the snail .
the other way that this is now a few years ago than this is just the way that the media is .
there was a train in the front of the trees , because the whole thing that was being able to grow
genes was produced with green buildings .
genes have somehow sense .
ph , oh , there are genes .
there were moments where the market was really got to get farmers : hey , i have an italian vegetable .
no one idea of what it means to be yes .
so , yes , well , nelson susie , we can be able to do it
but at the time i went to work on , i was still going to work on the lab and i was totally depressed at a very , very little bit of a while , because i
and it was totally frustrated , came home , and i was called a guy called teacher : `` you can not be happy . what is that ?
i like that , yes , i 'm going to try to change a little bit of three and a little bit for three days , and that
this was what i tried to explain , so somehow a community , genes , i thought , yes , is the good lady when i talk about the genes , they do what they call .
so that was what i really meant , which is a certain kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of
but that was what the woman has to hold .
this woman , he told me , is he never going to
who knows what i was wearing to be a lawyer ,
genes is a very poor thing .
now that 's already for 10 years now , and yet it 's kind of consciousness that 's kind of consciousness
genes that is , it 's missing .
i did n't read in a long time .
it 's always been able to open and it will be a lot of the body and it 's actually
fortunately , after europe , was an illusion .
but what happens is that there 's a lot of other other other satellites that actually has
another one , the most common , we can die rats .
yes , that was also a nice proposition .
but they 're not as old and it 's really hard in what i 'm doing to feel like i 'm happy .
anyway , whether the image or the image , all the talk of labor .
fortunately , it 's not even a shoe in the bible , but i 'm afraid that does n't get any time .
but that just show you what physics does in the population , because it just does n't get to the same with the same
we have to have some of our future in our future .
now , in just now , nobody had the big on the subject , but they will be made up about things and they had the most real thing that most of
and that 's pretty sad .
how does that information actually actually have this information from the lab ?
if we imagine this little , young , religious scientists sitting in the lab , an experiment , something , beautiful , beautiful , and it 's actually thinking , you know , the person , that 's what the public is .
then the one thing to go to the boat .
the head who will remember , okay , is cool curious , is to put his name as a trick , which is always important in science , to be honest .
good idea , i still do n't go in the public , it 's about a disaster .
yes , the older people , oh , oh , great idea , great , we make a computer factory .
so , in accident , we have a computer program with a project , a beautiful idea , and that 's kind of the way out of
this is going to be a chance of the fact , yes , but
now these are the active system of being done by several times , and they have to have a common set of
and from all of these , you get the surgery , the right thing , the right thing , you will get the luxury at the family , where the institution , whether it 's in the dark ,
that 's the path .
from the ground , it 's going to keep up , it 's going to keep up , in the fall up , and really quite work on the fact that really , in
these are the same stations , who are really good , you 've got to be free from all of the world there , but is , who are i
basically , just the one that care is interested in care of care
in the meantime we 're always , we 're always going to be the
so the ones that may have interested in the case that the telephone has then , yes , are beautiful and good .
nice magazine , once the blood guys who care about it , and they may have some idea about what a lot of the day is , in fact , in that dish
who is the most part of the people who really
the bottle that it really works about .
now , the decision that was now right now , the so-called actors , i call him the name of mr. uncle , who read the other other letters , i tried to keep it too much , which i did n't really get to
but again , again , our future will only be kind of like us in a way that we 're dealing with these
in addition to einstein , energy , energy energy , the way that they 're all kinds of things that are being accepted , that the god smile are n't really going to understand , and
my project , my idea is to take different of these little , young , brilliant scientists out from the training , really completely from his personal success , and to give him a success , a classroom , like science , and
now what happens is that a scientist that i have a meeting , and we 've been doing it for good for a number , and it 's an expert thing to ask us a cup of questions that it does n't ask to
once he was talking to the mouth and told his job , he told us .
so , leo , these are scientists who tell you what one of them who is
now , luckily , hear the level of , you hear , actually , the way that 's almost almost as
and the common groups , which is , oh , you do n't know what the end of it
and the really thing to do , you know , you know , you know , you 're nice and you 're in a conference and you want to get your own , you know , your favorite thing , you can tell yourself about the
where 's the problem , that you really have to talk about it and happiness
so i went to school , which is my idea , these young scientists who are not going to be much so far in the extreme plane that have a little bit of a body , that school i decided to call
it 's kind of making you all the use , the things , the way , the government that want to know what happens in the 1970s .
and finally , this is also as well as cancer as you have used to it , so you have to communicate the same
but the way that this is , which is just one story .
so i also want to put you a church of a church and you want to imagine your project , and your project is to say your project , you know , you know , you 're
there 's a quote , i do n't know if that 's the real thing , of course , with an ancient yorker : if you ca n't just explain it , you do n't really
so , the scientists from the lab and the project really started to figure out how to communicate this really normal , how could i really really
and like stories are already there .
now , luckily , that 's really , is modern , it 's everywhere , in every university of the university , but also there i actually just get to
who 's going to have to be the end end of the city at the university of some hair , and are going to get a talk
these are the people who do it anyway .
i 've got my ph.d. again .
so , these are the people who care about the most fun who are going up there and there 's going to be some quick
that 's beautiful , there are certain speakers made , all they 're happy , they 're happy , they 're happy , and that 's it .
so i 'm still looking for a second point , which is not on the project on this project .
these scientists also also even more than more than as are real children going
because many really tools have come to reduce this .
because scientists , like the research , and how children do their world , is what they are .
kids work very hard , really .
they make something like this .
they 're trying to figure out what is it
now , luckily , keep up , impossible , does n't work , you know , i 'm going to change a few characters , i 'll
children learn extremely technical .
these are really nuts , ladies and gentlemen , i 'm hoping what i do , what i 'm going to do , i have to change this ,
that 's normal !
but that 's got a lot of films
and so from the way , i think , really work can only be able to take the stage and have those scientists in the neighborhood , in the neighborhood , in the neighborhood , in places with the children in the neighborhood , and they really got to that because i believe that the children and the scientists actually actually talk about
and then you might be able to do the same thing , maybe the way the children would go home and then i 'm also crazy , but i 'm also going to get crazy , which , for the future of science , that the children will tell it
this is not somewhere somewhere in the newspaper , which is n't somewhere somewhere on the front , but your children have been doing it for the fact that it 's a bread that was made out of paper , and then you might see it also as a way of being a house
and not just that , i 'm not just in , of course , mr. gore ,
this is my idea , my vision , my project .
unfortunately , it 's just about the first brothers i 've been calling , saying , yes , so , you know , you need to do this , for the scientist , that 's just an idea that 's just going to other other .
a scientist needs not to be able to communicate .
yes , i think of thinking , okay , i 'll call the next next thing .
but who somehow works in a war system , a member of a company , like in the world , and there are a few other going
thanks a lot .
i 'm crazy , that 's the question .
and if you 're not able to fly it ,
the last couple weeks was bad .
the weather has a large source of what we do .
seven , i have been asked eight years ago , and i 'd like to take here to the point
i 've been amazed to be on the minister 10 years ago in the late season gallery in norway and in
we 're pretty far there for the top .
had an adult language .
and for me , it was really more , well , that 's kind of a sudden
what is that supposed to do ?
so , the way that is , it 's
i then know who i was going to have to come from here and i 'm going to
and yet , maybe it 's a little bit crazy , but it 's also very negative at each case .
it 's beautiful and it 's still been exciting and it makes no
and i 'm just going to tell you to the next director , and i 'm going to tell you a little bit
i 'm in the grade business .
the company has been in a hundred and a half years .
i 'm an american grade .
this company has been for 5,000 years .
and the one of the season season
the company has been for about 700 or a half years .
the one on the front here on the 1990s here
abracadabra .
this image i want to show you with this is the little slide , this is actually a kind of a red way , like , like , a design of a design , or something does n't , exactly , exactly , exactly ,
there is now only only only dumb surgery .
and they 're actually just about 10 pairs here .
that 's what happens .
there are about 10 thousand active active per thousand times .
so that 's actually not a market .
that 's not even an opportunity .
this is a gallery , a baby .
and the question is , why do n't you do this ?
how do we do this ?
in the case , only 10 times , we can talk about why this is like .
very short to history .
now , fortunately , one of many , crazy , i started an crazy ,
very few of them .
he started to put up to the first war war on the first war war in the
then in the first war , an ceo of the day died of the bush and the bush , there was a tremendous bush
they then put it in london and on and so forth .
and as we were able to come up and eight to london , and with a large asteroid there , there was a german campaign , and the english brothers was full of the writing brothers , and the ones they come , and they were n't with mobile ,
so , the story is happening there .
and we had an wrong plan .
but luckily , the cancer man , was n't as big as that , because of the fact , because of the way it suddenly realized was what old memories were from there ,
and guess that was to be a little bit of a little bit of
but anyway , in london , it was a good campaign on the weather in the north years where many years ago were already very bad and very surprising
and we 're not very far in a lot of
then , in german 13 , the soviet minister of the bush bush has been
and one of the a sudden , he 's been able to put america to
this has taken a cool internet that 's been known for the entire 10 nation over the back of the five nation .
there was a new york in new york .
and the whole 10 percent is a disaster machine , we 're again .
that 's what it 's in all the living , and that 's actually the easy to explain a little bit of this
but in fact , then on a photographer of the fact , it 's actually five and six , six , seven of the most of the world 's still built in it , and it 's actually just two
titus , a hundred , where a physician dies of english bike and a half year-old , it was
it was an internet theory .
and then the first rate of the time was that the first life that was published in the first place
so the way the power of the time is where one of the people who 's going to have a single call , a product of a
also the other ones have been raped .
and in fact , the last one still name even more common papers
the ones that make materials use for the materials , the old , the active towers
then a lot of things had been doing for a
and then the people who had to do was put up and had the minister , and they had the idea , maybe it would start
and i became a writer , because it was really , really , a great product , in a moment , but the market .
is he even a market ?
what is there ?
that 's like that
we 're talking about that on the
the poet minister , which may be to be a little bit before to explain , we 're actually going to go back in front of the world 's room
there are many companies that are built out of this factory .
it 's now been older to about 20 billion pairs .
this is a real economy , high business rate .
there 's a lot of behind it .
they also believed to come here , too .
the surgeon 's actually actually actually be a normal plane if any other plane has also , but , sorry , sorry , it 's a gas , it 's not going to be a gas player , and it
it 's like a giant one that 's coming on in water and in your seats and it 's got a pencil
now it 's not now not now being in the details of being at the
it looks a three-dimensional like this , and it 's a little bit
there are two types of surgery .
there are actually the bush , which is us , in fact , in the case of a
they have no structure in the right structure , and they 're like the blood vessels
these are the most people who were built in the world , on facebook , five piece .
and there 's only today , as i said earlier , only even even in the middle of a sudden , even in the head of our own being ,
this is what happens to the production when a piece of a piece of water
the structure again , again .
and the one piece is also spongy .
come from the garage .
of course , the chief rate of the world
and then the other thing happened in the world
costs one , two million pounds such as a one .
and that 's to be a way to be a writer to be a more job and to be able to be an expert , because now to come back to be something that if you have a pencil in it or a
there are now going to make a bomb bomb , and they 're going to see that it 's
and at the end of the end , a gps lamp is without the oxygen going out like
the ceo is really critical an asteroid .
and you see that here , in the bottom , in the bottom , very short
one is nine percent , one in five , nine percent , one in six , four percent , one in six , four percent , which is that by a thousand thousand
that 's very , very small and very good .
this is a disaster surgery .
it can happen to see .
but there 's another trend that makes us a moment of interest , and that 's what i 've been doing here
we had been called percent when i started three years ago when i started a little bit of a few five years ago , and we had eight percent in the last year or 60 percent
and this year in may the year in which we were at a
if you want to take eight years , my family , at a heart party and i 'm going to tell you , in the eight years of time , you can say in the eight years of eight years , of course , an extension of the interview , and you know
we 're psychiatrists .
we can not be able to fly the boat out through the
they want something to see .
and the main people who are actually going to go through in this one year
so a small thing that our culture does n't just seem to be very , but also too , because we 're going to have a day of space
but because it 's so true , that 's now good at the top of the institution in a program , almost 10 million dollars , and we 're an art part of this program .
i 'm just going to be on south of northern
the gps piece here is here is a flying flying lab .
and the bush is the campaign .
and we 're doing in our heads for the ministry between the ocean and the
that 's called the translation of the
and the former t 's disease comes to mexico from the southeast ages of mexico to mexico .
now , over many a few thousand , you have the same , you know , a lot of a number of steps are in the sun , and the air ones
there , i just say , there 's a little bit of the second side here right now in the
a great one , a great voice .
and if you want to take a look at some of the kind of cool
so that 's very good at all .
and here 's one more .
the conversation over seven week or a half week .
and in mexico , the weather is incredible , more , more degrees , more degrees , by 100,000
the most promising thing you do n't have it before .
i just had wonderful , beautiful , at a moment .
the seeds were n't that bad .
we were in africa .
and for the king , for king , as a photographer , we saw the better car amp , which is the nest of the nest , the nest maintenance
and just to say , it 's all africa , that 's the same thing when you ask yourself to the point of reason to be , for one idea , to be positive questions , in fact , at the end of the
i 've been asked to myself , what do we do in there ?
and what do we feed in that ?
at the end we have been done for two years ,
the wind line then we were not going to go
the whole recession came out of the way , and the project was going on
and a dish in the front of the front at the front of the press was then the way that he could actually
but it was n't so bad .
there was good and actually , really nice .
that was the final prototype .
and i did n't know what to do with it .
yes , what we 're doing today is a very short clip from the spectrum .
what we 're doing today is just about the fact of complexity , it 's about the complexity , it 's about questions , growth or so
what we 're doing today is the ted stage here in a classroom
we 're doing the street of .
we 've been still getting rid of the time .
and it 's called the ``
there 's always some ants in there , after 10 , you have come to the store where the more being you
we 're now just to the whole success of this success for almost five
and so with the patient , we talk about it .
we have to keep doing the job quo .
we 're an extraordinary engineer who is going to be able to control the two brothers and the european movements in the world 's going to be able to be able to be able to do it
that 's also more and cost and money and has to be even further .
the question is , do you go to continue ?
do you want to develop a more
do you do bigger ?
there are superstar , plus mice .
what do you actually do ?
are you going to go to the market ?
are you going to go to the store ?
and we used that in my time also try .
and we also have a few old campaign .
as the late poet , some of the earliest brothers had won some , and was an
at the beginning of the greenland at the beginning , the five and the
the population of the german population has been used at the time , with six million centigrade as a photographer , when the average was diagnosed were raped , and he was basically an popular , and the population
and it 's even the most successful artist director , and the other companies , you know , we 'd be able to do it or i 'm going to do not now ,
we were in tokyo , kentucky .
we were , and they listen to the lab , to san francisco with a client .
and that was a very frustrating computer .
and both of them are actually touched .
so , too .
at the same time , we have won
i have no image of it because we ca n't show the privilege of the ancient sector .
but in america , in america , the only era of the first stage in action is going
we have been thrown three times .
we 're using a cancer technology , like one with a cancer , and technology is
and that 's a great success , but at the same time , i 'm
two characters have been raped because it was n't .
why did n't it ?
we actually know what it really is .
either the same thing is not the right or the boat to have a far , far at a time , or in america that they have been invented to have an early about
the people who have won , that have seen the structure , they said , `` oh , again , again , again , again , again , that
there might be the case that you can actually be able to be able to
and it was actually less difficult in marketing to try to get this , hey , people call it and go out .
we 're doing good at all
the breast people who have come in the year , including vegas , mary bush .
but last year we just have been just cut around the walls .
and then you have a half million million .
that 's bad , right ?
the highway line of an opera park here .
it 's the sense of being beautiful , which is beautiful when i look at it as if the press were getting and then the way the boat are going to be lost and , and we 're actually not going to be able to buy it , because it 's actually so nice , and the people who say that 's beautiful , and they
and we 're great disaster .
i 'm going to get to get back all the time that we 're thinking we 're going to
you could still do more active .
we have a ph.d. board at the age of the day , and we
that 's actually not true , actually .
we 're also doing surgery .
this is the process of the field that was called its electric device .
and she won this thing here with the island of kenya .
but the irony is a longer market .
and you need to ask the question , you know , do n't it make it ?
we actually have enough breast cancer , but internet has changed a lot to have the head of the start on the back of the day .
the surgeon is a major school student , so there 's only 10 years now in the world today .
we have three here .
two hundred years , one of the things that is in the opera department , three has bought a child
so there are six to six .
that means that we are actually going to be able to control the market when it 's ever one
and hope , it also , again , to become a future again .
and what happened at the end of david heart , the ceo of the apollo church , after his former island and five , he said , `` now , the walk on the front
so , 1986 is beautiful .
advertising is also going to happen us .
we do n't find any customers .
and so the way to make it is , we 're going to find
we have a patient .
it 's not rocket .
it 's insane , it 's coming and down .
this is like a system of war for years to get to .
and then it 's not a little decade .
there 's also a strange effect that can be just and hard to control .
and in every case , that 's the situation , in fact , one point in the world , you have no
yet we do keep .
it 's a state of the region .
the terrorists have the power to do it .
they just kind of question : in what form do we take it ?
how much money do we have to put in the world
what do we do for here ?
what does that mean , does that should get the
and i personally , you 've been asked me to do something personal , which i 'm going to do is to spend a little bit of course , but i 'm actually asked to talk to my favorite point , and i 'm going to have to get a little bit of my
i was also even at three years of time when i was a writer at the jewish island and all the way i saw this whole bill -- it 's kind of like me to see me .
and at the time , there was a campaign over the local people who are in money and not the question they should do with it , and almost to have it
there they were in the way to actually do it .
and i 've been doing for the three years for three years , and now i now now , in hope , a long future for a long time in
zero , right ? it 's like , `` june seconds , i 'm still ready ,
sebastian betti
yes , thanks a lot .
that 's my three points that i want to talk to the most and minutes of minutes
why are we now today in the multiverse today or the classroom
how do we get to build a train
and most importantly , what do you do ?
what is the point about this ?
let 's start with our first point .
the first one is maybe a little bit of sight .
but it 's also going to also to show the challenges .
a few years ago , this was harder to explain that .
that we have a problem today , which is why every child is
that we have problems .
but it 's always used to get to the top of the world 's worth the challenges that growth has growth .
all kinds of marketing are larger times .
if you see a long bit long at the time , the victim for instance , this will be a very short student in the history .
now , we can not imagine ourselves that it 's kind of being different to the fact that it 's going to go back
you know the climate climate change over the last time .
some people say , well , we got it in , but we 're going to see the last 5,000 years .
you can also look at this as well , as you can see , ``
you can say who needs the other world ?
you can also say the ocean is far away .
but it 's then going to come back to a little bit more than the real challenges , to help things that really , to really , you know , we 're just interested in trouble that are really unique to health .
and it 's a little bit for a long days of
and there 's happiness , in our cities like in sports , or a way , always , always , always , really
it 's also about the surgery , it 's all in asia .
think about the equator where the great hadron collider and the crash of these who get to go out of water from the ground .
it 's not about the planet in the last world .
the planet is the square age of the age , which we do , there was a lot of bigger
and in addition to join it , but it 's around us to get the people who are going to be very close to a whole
it 's about being consumption of carbon culture .
the female areas of the charges are coming
the dome is going to get less .
this is the sea floor where an actual function of our inner ice looks away
and that all , where does that come from ?
all of these things , i 'm going to move out , literally in the one or other form of global use .
with what we 're looking at , we 're moving out of the earth , which we
not only that the oil and the bears and the beauty , but also the traditional materials are in charge , but at least , it goes on .
and we 're just going to see that we can use it as a little bit of it , and it 's going to be less open to
so it 's about now that this is actually told to actually really get all the whole process of the process of the
this is the challenge not only to be political , not just b , two , not one of a car to a car , really different to life .
different thing to economics .
our technology completely has to change .
if we just have a little bit of the boat and go down , and there are still in the world of societies who are essentially living in this way , with a chemical social rate in the year per person and
in a nutshell , it was in the recent era of the human history of three or five tons .
today it 's 4,000 to an emergency age .
so , watson has changed this kind of thing
and he 's very , very smooth on the earth .
it 's more than in the north of america more than us that we 're going to have to be square than
and in other parts of the world , they 're very , very less in africa .
and in order , we 're looking at the impact of what the brain air is , much better than the last decades , but what it is in the most is the way that we 've been able to bring this into other
and the other parts of the world goes to do that , and it 's always
and so , the atmosphere that we see , from the way , from the base , is , in afghanistan , where they look at it , they look at it on the side of the american union , and they see
and that 's where it 's particularly frustrating , in particular , what it means there are many , many materials there , where the world 's the
so if we want to add it with the subject , we need to spend ourselves with the
so we have to change , the public boundaries , all the time , are the ones 's going
and that 's what we 've live here at a professional life right now .
now that was what happened to the former hair when he said that the world has enough to anyone , but not for the people .
and there we are , as we live in average life , in a way .
that 's like that
that was the kind of thing i was in
but i 'm always thinking that you need to understand , to understand , to really understand what to do .
even if i would say it 's going to be as much as it as to live , it 's more light .
but it 's always going to be done by the traditional algorithm , but it 's a kind of a genius , i 'm going
so what is going to go ?
and we need to realize that we have a lot of a rich parts of the world that has been done so much , in many ways , in many of our lives , in our lifetime of
here 's a pretty bad puzzle here , but there are people , and they also know people who do n't really can work as well with this story .
i 've wrote a little bit .
and the irony of climate change that the same cause
we work too much , too hard .
this is on the one side , and we 're in touch , and eventually it 's too much .
i also love to work too .
and on the other hand , we just take that kind of loss
but what about good life ?
how do we define this ?
now , a little bit of a little bit of a
and also the thing that i 've said before , and what i 'm going to say is , how do i tell you about how much more important , but here 's what i think is how i
and there 's important , to understand , of course , has two options .
now , what happens is the point of the evolutionary conditions i 'm going to eat .
i 've got a roof on my head , right
i asked friends ?
i 'm on the relationship , i can be in life ?
but also , how do you get to how do i take to it ?
i 'm a journalist that sometimes most common life .
and then i 'm going to go and then i 'm going to show two questions that are
that one is one .
the need to have a physical level of our human development system , our place , is to make a difference .
if we can predict our needs , we 're happy .
and you ca n't say you 're in charge of need to be sustainable or not
needs to make an heart problem not to use .
what are common ?
if you can do many scientists ' , i just call them two in here
and you see that there are physical choices , but they 're also in trouble , for social relationships .
after teachers , after 9/11 , after board , for the sake of the sake of the world , for
all of this has a little bit about money .
but in fact , in a large part , actually , in fact , that 's the question i can be able to make you this in
and i 'm on the second important term here .
the components .
the strategy i use to make the move to actually give this needs .
and there it goes , and then i can do it , which i 'm doing a high deal with a high scale or a
i can use a lot of money without without money .
and what i 'm going to do is what the difference of the brain
that happens to be my values with the resources , with the possibilities i have .
if i have little money , i 'll do anything like myself to act as if i was doing a lot of money on the police company .
it 's the privilege of the ancient world , that 's the roof over the head , and then it kind of the crash .
and here it goes , and that can be a lot of or little , or little , that can be a very sustainable system
and if we 're going to get the whole animal that i 'm going to get to , for my need to make my needs , then we
that 's like that
that was the kind of scientific research system .
and now what can we do now ?
how does it work ?
and that just just just a few options .
of course , everyone must find everyone for themselves .
but the evidence of the individual species on a kind of technical way , here i 've been , a lot about technology , and also in a political way .
so what can we do about this
so what can we do about this
what do we do ?
so where do we want to go ?
the computer at the beginning , in fact , in terms of the world , the danger is that we are always used more and more
and so in the end of the biology , you know , the quality of life that will be even worse , that the effect will be
or , if we can make it a little bit , like there a little way to do with less , maybe less carbon than a less more more more efficient system , but in a
there is one of my favorite clips , maybe i 'll be aware of some of the -- i 'm going to know some , in fact , an
there 's a lot to how do you know each single thing that we can use here , the sugar , the coffee , the one that the car is the car , the road , how do i make
and the way i 'm going to do is different different ways , i can build the house out of
in fact , in a lot less , there are less more than more than
my other teachers , i 'm going to put an artist journalist who is so said about the crash per crash , and we 're in the course of what 's been an event for today , because it 's going to look at the very
where are the need ?
what is the cure of the services i really
and how can i do that with doing so much ?
and that 's not with a little bit less with a toy , a designer , a child ,
there are many examples that this might be done .
in a nutshell , a genome system is built with three units of
with seven , it 's built in the classroom .
that 's basically the case out of liquid .
you know , if you can not take it in a hundred years , if you can do it , you can take it back to your parts and not in there , with all the other together you 're in the moment of the individual and the goal , with a dollar of the
but then a lot of life in our own , kind of , how am i really been doing ?
sebastian betti an wonderful book written , `` accident . ''
where he shows how hard it is , it really really been really looking from the things from this kind of light .
the surgeon i 'm going to take to take a lot of reference the other one , and then i 'm the very career in this in the
you have to have some kind of money that i 'd quickly show , and then i 'll go on . i
on the right line , i 'll follow the privilege that you all know .
when i started my lab in front of the research , a few years ago , we
then you have to wait , until you 're going to go to call the letter , `` i 'm going to write ,
it 's what i call about hundreds of email
and i can afford a lot more .
this is energy , this is economic , we 're going to go to the right
but i did n't really have time to go .
i did not to have a good job for myself
but there are good examples , more food , for example , where i really do the math of the quality of the quality and the spirit of the success
and with a very small system , more data can change
one of my favorite examples is a disaster
there 's been a way back here today , which is that most average person in our germany , was about 10,000 things in the house .
can you have started to power .
who had had two , three generations of thousands of stuff , had had killed , personal
they were able to meet the ones .
we have to beat up with it .
and increasingly less people come to realize that all the way .
and you need a press that allows us to help us with this little kind of things .
in other words , i 'm interesting , but maybe even even the way that you can go from the space , that i 'm , i do n't have a
the next example is worth to have some .
a real shark .
star , c , c has been in an old way in a financial way in an conventional environment .
in the meantime , it 's more than more people , if you think about it .
if you think about it , too .
kevin , the way to work on how to make the things we already have been built up this beautiful , a few hundred years ago , and still have to use it and even more of the other days that it 's about
that , in fact , it was just better to use .
this is another question of justice .
i 've been showing you how i 'm doing the web image of the world and europe and a single one world .
and in ways , all of the time with these resources can be used to be able to use less less than we have
and that does n't mean any more psychology because many of us have been doing things like a lot .
but it 's a important task for the economy , the company , these products , this services really , in fact , to make a good one , to create us a good life in a much less
last thing that also has to do with the great quality of politics is going to be a growth in the growth , and that 's
if you read a little bit of the actual , then it 's closer again , you know , you 're going to see the equivalent of every week the game game that
it means yes , a crisis is based on the door after my view and it 's after what we 've been talking about with the tools of instruments and with with the place that are available for the boat , and here 's the numbers for you to find this in a way for
and there is no reason to have a growth to the way i like this from my youth , from the previous few years .
it 's something that is very mathematical reasons .
one is five percent growth today is as much like eight percent growth per year .
and the eight percent is the thing that china has today .
they 're also in the process of thousands of years ago , we were in a
in all , if the player is bigger , of course , it 's still eight percent .
that 's a company in the one percent , and we 're going to get good
but you have to put it in a way that is , no even if we were to zero percent growth , that would be so much powerful and food and income have been like this year in this year .
we can invest that well , and we can work with it .
now , it 's not so much like this that the very least , because you know these objects that show the growth of the growth for the time , they do
the economy is growing , but the data health in exponential countries have more of the tv , on the end of it .
and also , jobs are being able to make a difference , and it does n't really matter that it 's very high , that it 's not so far at us that it 's
that 's just true , and then you have to get your education as well as the economy
and it 's over again and again , too , as opposed to as a week , which is what i call a week , which is what i call , in the developing world , a bigger story with
already , there 's been devastating feedback who were saying to write in his career to write that he said that good life is the good economy , the great economy of life , the good economy .
that 's the end of the day , not to make not sustainable to not about not sustainable , not to make growth for growth that we do n't even go on
for the sake of the world and these countries , too much than india , is also very much different story .
and that 's going to be used to just under a few of these days , when we 're going to grow up and we just go to this level of scale on this level of scale that we 're alive and developing
it 's got to change .
it needs goals .
it needs in the way the rules are saying .
it does n't just need the growth to be really and measure and ask , how does it actually with the quality of life , is that just the condition ?
is the cow ?
and then we also measure our politicians .
of course , how is the online process of uncertainty
how do you do this ?
we need a really principle of that , in fact , we have to reduce it and not to do
who you see the education with you , but also the family , knowledge , you know , that 's very
what kind of quality of control , we know even one of a death at first .
you could do it very different .
the resources are kind of business , and therefore the resources are the ones , not the work
and you 've got to get all the ancient sector to create it research , to create a local , a local way , to the
that 's what you need to do a little bit more .
that means , `` you can see more or less , in all the deep areas in the field of the work , we can make a lot better for us to ask us the real products , services as the military , to what we actually are , how do we
what do we need and what do we need to do ?
the real politics is , the one that we have to
a few characters i have .
and then at last point , the science of the world 's science was still the u.s. percent of the memory , and still we still focus
but unfortunately , nobody did .
if you look at the actual mind , if you look at the next 5,000 years , it 's all over the bottom , because it 's
politics is not able , and the purpose is not going to make growth , but it 's the question of how we go to the ones and the question that we have a good life of it
so , he 's just going to go out
it 's called the most popular point of surgery in
with heart , brain , hand , and the last thing is the place , you 'll have to
thanks a lot .
i 'm an undercover journalist .
and i love that town .
this city has so many stories to tell .
one of them has been to a few hundred years ago .
and it has to do with creative action .
i 'm going to play this creative problem here , and i 'm going to talk about
it will be done with the current gallery .
this is a more recent game , which is the inside of the city here in the middle of this town , and lots of that
another story before .
it was in a hot studio in virginia , pennsylvania .
a man who looks at his feet in his feet , that it 's really , really , really
that one is too much too .
he 's a private person , he knows that , he does n't know it
he 's doing one of the time he 's using the bus 's office device , and that is n't long to me , and there 's actually a lot
he put the studio again to become his name again , and he will see a new climate in the computer .
it 's the final death , it 's born .
and those number they 're seeing here here is the core side of the player 's likely on the most glamorous player .
a company is a disaster program , with four letters .
the one or the other of you know it .
he has even eaten the original idea , and he had won .
both have a big time .
so he says , well , ooh , i 'm going to make my own business
and the way is he left the depression .
today , several thousand children in the near world are now in the most near world of the
that 's how much more important design problem .
why not a new problem about that , what not happened about it ?
and what 's missing is that perhaps the question is that it 's also going to be
if you do n't know , if you do n't know , it 's for the time ,
i 've often thought this would have been taught me in pretty much situations .
if something wrong , or my neighbor does n't work or whatever it does n't work .
it 's got , you know , little memory
what is that a opportunity ?
and yet , you get off from the board board .
what this can do is i 'm playing in the game of this talk here
and another example ago , by the river ice survey , is going to work on it and the most famous
and the way that people can be able to be about how creative people can be , if it comes
so i want to show you a few examples here .
so those are actually the same guy in the river hall , and it also made it a vote .
i love the fantastic election .
my son did n't invent the woman .
he 's just an economist , he 's the woman in the crash .
or i had a ph.d. who had been to put me to the train , and suddenly a boy in my mind , and i would n't see the other car .
it 's obvious , who 's it ? right ?
the bush .
the twin people are mad .
i 'm a journalist , and i 'm almost married .
you can actually do me at the patient time for the patient .
the last one i was n't going to go .
fortunately , the young woman was in a coma .
if you 're a man , every more honest choice is really impossible .
if you 're a woman , you do n't understand it .
so people are more creative , we 're creative .
and i wish to me , and i dreams with the fact that we all need to use this creativity
many of us are in a german disaster .
and that does n't have to be that way
why not all of this stuff just to do things
old things we are going to do the research to be more likely to get us as a kid or a child , as the best
why not just do anything that can be a little bit more of a little bit like a
and there 's so 25,000 companies that use this .
for example , in the case , these have the privilege of their business , these guys or the wall for example , and there might be something like that .
also , a way , right ?
and then the coffee level for it , for example ,
or whatever .
we do n't have any framework , we do n't
is it a minute today , right ?
if you do n't just write the cell phone , you
or eat me , otherwise , we do n't eat it .
it 's blowing , but empathy .
this is something that is worth .
i 'm going to go on one of the doctors or the one of the doctors , and say , okay , i
the marketing one i 'm out of it
a german asteroid in the game of the game game , i think , in a game that 's
once the cell cell goes back the same news , even politics .
if you had three times of times , you have been an accident .
once they had the spread to eat the debate over long periods of food
it 's a commercial building , and the restaurant is small , so the children have all the hands of the hands .
it was too busy .
they 're thinking , together , what do we do ?
how do we solve the problem ?
we can not get faster up in the kitchen .
this idea is built .
every report will send a local device in the front of the body , an electrical device called a bicycle
so , the rate of the people in their hands of their hands have been able to have been able to do
just a different way .
a creative idea , and maybe a lot of a sudden .
there 's one person who 's not quite popular right now .
you 're the leader of the season , the prime minister of the resistance .
and most of the time , they have an average
and already the second day , which is still going to now , four days .
a company has won a local bomb for the month of the month , and you may think of it as
a journalist , though , is just getting out .
people come to visit us in the past world .
the walls are full , and it will destroy people , people have a system , because of any of the people of the other of others , of a day of
but why not even use anything to do something from the side of a sense of being a
sometimes , creativity is also as well .
and it comes out of a very , very quickly way , like in this company that you might know .
so we 've known that this is not really good good at all the time , but that they have to spend it on the board , but it 's something for the same
or in fact , the crash store .
we know that we can actually know the different , the same , the same ,
yeah .
why does n't a piece of coffee into the car when you 're driving ?
or at least , there 's also opportunities to create a creative way .
and all of this has just been able to do with humor , with speech , with sometimes is it stupid , huh
sometimes it 's funny .
once my favorite son was son , at the office of my
and on that level i was sitting on this .
so , we 've got a number of time around the world 's
and then he comes from the left to the left , he 's talking to speak , and i 'm saying in my talk to say this guy , listen to me , `` listen to you
he was telling me , big eyes , but , you know , the french .
and at the moment of the moment , i actually got to see it right , right
why is that not a secret ?
why is this what we do , not the price for adults ?
this one is really much more useful , right ?
if we 're wired , if we use our original devices , we do what we like to do .
and with doing it 's , very small thing , but
the higgs thing is that if a single day of the week goes to find what happens in our brain .
it 's the first day in the week , and it 's kind of the way we 're looking at
this is where we even talked about it in a moment
this is in the mall .
you know , you 're actually hearing it in the media .
it 's actually been a day to the beach .
or if you 've got the most beautiful time of the year , the court .
what are the rest of the most ancient weeks of the year
is it so terrible ?
now , have we all been happy jobs ?
a surgery had been on the front door , this issue .
yes , i 'm a little bit of the rest of the life .
or in lebanon , on facebook , in the social sector , there is a subject for the social
i then i took a lot of the job , one of the birth in
i mean , there are many companies and i like to look at it
what have the kind of interface that you have in the back of the day that
and then one day i 'm reading this business , i 'm going to buy this
and the first mate that you see here , yes , is actually quite nice .
so , with making it , rather than being a work .
i hated that , too , father 's dad who i know , i love my job .
yeah .
or soon at least , the fbi is sign for the same
why the person that get there to be worse , and it 's still going on , it 's more and
somebody has a answer for the way it 's not the crash , it 's your jobs .
and i 'm actually supposed to be in the wheelchair with the brown church , here it is coming up , and i say ,
what about my job is beautiful ?
the miracle of that is that it 's the same time that 's called the pink sex , it looks quite much
so , a nice thing to talk about , not beautiful , that 's not beautiful ,
the brown chimpanzee is actually a great one of the company .
and they 'll go a wonderful way and they would put it in the eye .
but too , they do n't care they 're
where does that mean , if we do n't change ?
in fact , in the job , the content , the one
within the company , outside than a thousand .
it 's like a system in a system where we feel like the mouse .
the mouse goes into this hole and goes in and out , and eventually it 's going to play this , and in a way , this device will have a name of the poor
what makes the mouse going to do ?
you know nothing else , it goes back into the same script .
and again , perhaps the film will be before you see the word `` you may '' it 's called the means you might
that 's beautiful , in the process here , so it 's a very successful thing to do .
and what we might be as if we probably feel that the mouse has actually put up to a mouse
or something else does it , that feynman cried is born
i was like this many years ago i was going to visit a car school at home .
and once the street took me , it felt up to be a black guy of my eyes and somehow a way i 'm going to stay .
the next day i went to the doctor , because i thought , what is there ?
he started to me and said , `` well , '' it 's a difference in
but what about the coffee ?
and i looked in my own car to see that , and i worked with three weeks , and i had sort of got a job in my own .
after two years in the class of the season and the researchers who have to ask in the early early questions , we can actually start to make
i also thought , well , what 's going to happen to be more ?
and i started to put up , to put up to the other other thing , to see that i 'm doing a little time with my family , something good for me
`` accident '' is n't it not necessarily not be able to have some other other other category in my
i have watched that talks to be a great amount of groups that i 'm doing to do
i 'm going to go up and also you like to have a tv and a lot of other things , but these are the talks to help these talks , some of
and that was n't always the way .
i have to realize that this ancient ambition is going to make free .
and sometimes , it 's really right to the front of the screen , and it 's been a little bit more than the hospital , after he had a heart , and he starts to see it , and he started
i used to say you , you walk with me , he always been in my head , yes , you 'd walk with your walk .
today , he goes to anybody .
so , with a toy , beautiful times , in the real stage , but in the end we 'll have all together .
what happens ?
and the bottom line is , we 're all
the court down down , but a curve goes to the conversation , is the food of the human health .
adam is the only 20 years of 10 years , and , you know , almost the other 's la percent , which is really , you
and of course , as we can see , it
this is something i think about myself , is that ?
why is that ?
is this just in the computer ?
no , even in germany , it 's like this .
it 's got , leo , the way to put it
that 's the one that can be able to see here on the
and down to the top , there are probably estimated that there are almost a hundred percent reduction in the last 10 years ,
the number of birth of the ancient death collider takes
the cost .
and so you think of all kinds of resilience , what can we do with this topic ?
make it also , it also also become the same as well as well as a minute
so , good story .
and somebody said that no failure is not a solution .
but what about the solution ?
what is the thing that we 're doing to make a healthy power and a lot of joy ?
and that has come to me the last few years .
i 've been thinking , is there something like this , could it be something that something is like this
i 'm certain that the job is not what we 're supposed to get into and happy with a happy .
there are many other things that are important to family , family , faith and so on .
but in fact , we 're going to spend the biggest part of our childhood age of work .
and if we do , why do n't we do that , it will have joy to us , and it 's also a different
the german minister i 'm going to give you a few final time is to have a more personal thing to the
these little notes that you 're trying to see if you think you 're
and it 's to be used in the political way of power
that means , how did you know ?
in which environment , i mean , is that with the people who are
what freedom is i , i have here , do i do this , what do i want
because the rate of the season that was being asked .
the more of it , the more translation .
and what do i do this ?
the bigger one .
and that 's where those four areas of
and it can be , everyone , for themselves , to
i had to look at this for myself , a few years ago , and i always do the research
can i use my policy ?
in which environment ?
and that means sometimes i 'm going to go into a car with my laptop , to make sure of the most expensive words
the freedom of freedom .
the freedom of freedom i can take to do is to do this what matters to me .
and i 'm going to do it ?
the bigger one .
the last thing .
and then there 's always a little bit of people who are telling me why that does n't .
and why to them , that 's a lot more difficult
then i really really like to think a answer about this .
who wants to find some way .
who do n't have a sense .
and by the way , you can choose yourself the question of being in , i think , are i better or why ?
and they will be quite right in both .
so what do we do with our shoes ?
each of them has been taken his great divergence .
it 's a lot to get you all .
that 's filled with fire , with kenya , with all kinds of power with their skills .
what do we do about it ?
so , by the way we 're asking this .
or if we 're in the hospital or the end of a life or
so what did i do with my email ?
by the way , that guy has already put on a regular device , and i can just get
so , what we 're doing with our email , is my first question , even in my own , but in my own , i think
so i 'm going to do the question ,
and resources .
there was something a story about a story .
i wanted to tell you about a nuclear world
and the most word i 'm going to do is now .
this was the basis of the day for a while over 14 years ago , the blood guys came
and the blood signs realized that this was a very good place that you could n't take on .
empty walls were estimated ways that can lead to the end of the day and ice windows were actually identified
and then the christmas was in
so the point that , if we do n't get away , we 'll build a disaster .
we do n't have any more ones out there .
let 's look at how long and they are doing this .
the surgery did that , it was taken from long to a day where the nest sea was almost accepted
they just had a more member member of this , already to get to become a more member of the way , to be able to go to the store than the master minister , and give me three
bruno 's okay , i 'm a student you 're in , i 'm a journalist , right , take the airplane and help us .
we 're going to get that way a little
at once one of the people 's blood are like the wall of the next house 's house , it will be taken back again and again , in the early month
all right , think about the , an asteroid , what is already .
it 's been late .
again , a german partner , at the top of the report , is what he is black .
so , you think , `` you think , oh , that 's just two , two , you 'll be
at the end of the same thing that i 've done , this is the most popular guy who 's on there and then it
at the end of the second day , after the six different speakers , you have seen it in a dish .
because they thought that they thought that we were going to take a long time that we 're not going to
and then the storm went down to the bush and the bush 's court
the one that they had , they had the ones they 've got .
and that 's the primary gallery in the ancient
i like to talk about this thought that everything is there we need , and we have everything .
sometimes it 's going to be a private resources , sometimes it 's not going to be much ,
but also , we can do something about that .
we have no idea of power that we have to invent the world 's own .
and if you think that might be a good dancer , then you can be right .
in the middle , the forest is the
that comes from .
and we 're seeing in our own knowledge where the street industry will be there and the plants coming out of the lower and the lower gold 's lower foot
there 's actually been a little bit of a little bit of
there are a very clear side of this , very popular that we can grow
there is now this one that can be able to do this , and then ,
there 's a lot of animals that are eating .
there 's people who just eat the products they 've ever eat .
and it 's going to get rid
maybe it may not be that it 's not all that is , it 's not so much , it will be a fear
and of course , that 's the threat may only be very unusual , and it 's also very , very popular in the area of the small atoms , the connection from the flower to the plant
there are research which show , in fact , that until there are more percent of our food , and they do n't even have a food system if
and that sounds like so far because it 's so normal for us , and we 're just laughing at it as not so that .
there was also a very interesting movie about this for a while .
and i assure you , look at it .
but now , we 're looking at the title of the film , the one of the bees at the same time with the bees , the meaning of bees in their
that 's what he 's doing to a school at heart , and he 's now a little bit about his work
please , mr. assistant .
yes , good evening .
it 's just a big case on my son and the whole thing i 've been
i 've been able to make a project here with my project , and i 'm going to have to make
and also , even under a woman , a toy can be something about small hour to say that does n't
because i 'm going to suggest that the moment of the world 's most of all of you is now going to be the same day today to go to the ted 's ted age in
i do n't want that , no .
but maybe it might be like me to convince me to love those campaign or to have a certain relationship with you and to it , and to try to think of this , this is an interactive device , and
my name is thomas bush , who is a wonderful woman , who died of a wonderful woman who not did n't have any muscle in five children , and a different artist and a fellow soul and a month of the day in the election age with
i 'm a member in the journal grade magazine , and in the indian republic of
and now , in the late 1980s , i 've been doing the oldest canyon at the time with
we 're working there in the garden , in agriculture and in our history .
and what 's happened is actually a game of an abstract , and is a passionate actor
our daily life is more an water , a silence , a quiet thing .
and she also also come up .
it 's almost a disaster issue .
and not free has been the old state of the relationship between the quality of the body and the former minister of an ancient journalist
and in a wonderful note of `` charlie '' he explains how the privilege of the privilege he stopped to try his campaign to try to get out that he can get some
but the irony is n't even alone , but they 're going to send their blue bees and they 're now the old force force with the sex and the game and they just go out and they 'll be able to send him the words like
a beautiful image .
hopefully that , i hope , i 'm going
yeah .
this is flying .
i come to the project .
one of these adventures , this journalist , is the right now to my students with me together with a 30 to the very successful days in a
in the high schools of us in the u.k. in rwanda in the 1970s , in the 1980s of the child in the 1970s , or in
a asteroid who have been to speak to an emergency party or a classroom
the teacher that this project will take to me with me in the class and we 're looking for a picture place for such a coffee
mostly the windows with the kids in the table can see the children as this
and most of all , the bees around the plants , then they 're getting out there by the nest of the car , and
there will be a mountain structure on the window .
that 's like that
and then the whole thing begins on me on the crash .
so i 'm going to take a coffee experiment and a question of the next few minutes of a bunch of two , two square clips and i 'll
and i think that 's important on this for the ancient school workers
and also , we 've got an israeli knee here , and here 's one to the side now , now , we have to
and then also a coffee , there is a coffee accident .
there 's the oil inside inside there .
they need them , if they have bad weather , they can fly .
that 's like that
this is what it looks like .
and then the next stage over here and immediately starts to the link of the world 's room or for this kind of high place in school .
and now it starts to start a wonderful
ladies and gentlemen , these bees over here , then they have a crisis in the class , they have a
they 're not getting out of it .
they 're infectious .
they do n't find their queen .
and that 's the most important thing that when you believe that this detector , it means he 's going to go out that the queen 's first ,
so that this is not in those two stages .
and they 're sad , these bees will be sad
they start to e .
yes , the phrase says , they 're confused .
you hear this .
they 're almost likely to take a more longer higher than they normally lived in their career with a queen
and now a catastrophe starts on here .
ladies and gentlemen , in a night now , now now now , you 're going to have the need to have a new relationship and all the rest of the whole thing without a little bit of a sudden , a student
here 's the people in front of you , and it will , in the first night , there
because without the queen , you could n't have an idea for six weeks after
because , in fact , there are only six weeks
that 's like that
and in this first night , she would take a pen out of one of these steel factory a pen , a video and put it
and then we would be able to get that magic out
anybody who had been told you to the school store , say how to do it ?
yes , energy browne , but it 's all complete disaster .
that 's true .
and now it starts to start a wonderful
this robot , which is usually a bank , has become a queen in the game of the season .
the chimpanzee 's first three days of the first three days of the road to the
after that , it will run off a meter for the
you know that magic , you know
and immediately , on these coffee , on the genetic code on the genetic code .
the surgeon are going to change through the bush in the 1970s .
we 've been told that before we eat , which means what we 're going to do .
and the queen 's really wonderful to experience .
three days , five days , five days are in front
and that can be a student all of the students
you see that in the same time .
and then that cell will give you a system of a system of a system of a system of water , and the whole thing either happened , because the people now now the big sector , it 's going to be a
no , that happens .
ladies and gentlemen , that 's a coffee , or a german designer .
and then the students die for eight days , in my students , and three five eight eight a blind , they 'll have spent twice before that
and so day , if you should go to the teacher , the teacher has been a little bit before you had a little bit before the crash at the student at five o'clock at
and then the mother says , `` tell me , what is that with you ? ''
yes , i have to school .
yeah , why do that ?
yes , our queen sons .
yeah ?
and then the people in the school are six to school .
and then they had their own boss 's head to this keyboard because she wants to be able to give up what the queen 's
and if you really do that , then you can hear something about this .
the queen won .
that 's like that
i 'll just do a little bit
and then the geese come and they 're doing this queen 's going
the first thing that this virus makes , it uses your iphone and is now with your heart of these people , who has a breast , has a dog , their name , their neighbor , their eggs
the people now get to build a identity .
now , three and five days , the queen has been asked .
from the 1980s , they get their own garden system .
and back in the back of the nest , from the people coming from this dish
and after five days , the queen will take the queen out of the crash
some people think , yes , i 've seen a lot of time , such a crash in the classroom
wait , put up .
which is going to happen .
let 's do that .
and this is the queen that goes on without no one , without the end of the car out to two kilometers in this
have you ever seen a moment before this has ever seen .
in the meantime , and you can see in a more recent moment , this is an instant , and seven to 12 , the
so the way in terms of islam like this man in the state of the world , the man 's different women , is the queen
and this is in a wonderful way in the window .
the drone is made the queen , and the queen is now going to be able to put all of the queen that they need to take in between america to take three years long .
it also has an amazing experience for the gps one .
if you 're finished with the bomb , you 're going to die and it 's dead
and then the queen comes back and starts to train the eggs .
there 's always one , two students that you see on the right .
they 're also going to see the queen .
yeah .
and then the project in school is now going to the next school , now now , the fbi will become an opera and the queen and the police industry will now
and then i get a night at the end of the day .
and so the other thing that 's been the most exciting thing that is out , and at the next morning , i 'm going to take this poster with
and there 's a queen here in there .
yeah .
sebastian betti
and it 's mostly 10 to 12 degrees per day
and then this one , those two speakers come here in a toy .
in a space of light , a single one game is a single one , and now it can become
why bees in school ?
ladies and gentlemen , the children who have the same thing , they forget more .
yeah .
there is no way in the class that the students are doing all the time with the bees , but the whole school has come to be in that class .
and the teacher , if he knows something if he can do something , he can have a little time after the other one .
look , bees and even about 5,000 years ago , we 've been going to have the force where people are invented the force .
a few months ago , you have been found in israel and a few months ago , in fact , the bees have been done
we have more of our social culture with bees .
or in other ways , the bees were in every culture .
in china , in india in tokyo , in egypt , in southeast circles in northern ireland .
everywhere they were .
human cultures are mine , and i wrote the human life , and
he can put a bmw , a minister , he can put a crash .
ladies and gentlemen , you know , what the drugs or the bees were n't for the bees , what they
you know , there 's a little bit there right now in the summer of agriculture .
this is where this is a green store for our bees .
yeah ?
he can go to the students in the 1960s and then the flowers plants , where they were able to be able to jump the way they face , and how long do you have to do this
how long are you on the individual ?
and as long they do , they will come back again .
it can be used to see a few
how did i get a ticket ?
yeah .
you know , if it 's like that , the wheelchair is the top one , or is an flat side on the left side .
look at that moment .
he can go with a mathematics , a hypothesis .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , he can even find the crash quo on this square trip .
and then he comes to the question , how could a member of the chicken that the crash could have to
because he has learned the bees that are seeing in the desert .
but , ladies and gentlemen , in a tribe store , is the boat .
there 's a side of this that 's going
and just the professor of the professor , who has an amazing journalist at university , who has an amazing point in the university that the bees who are going to make a hypothesis on a
as an industrial network of the game system on the google game , you can see a square device with a bicycle , and now with a sudden with a teenager with a teenager , and the bees that are going to take
you see what those bees are in school ?
it 's actually been an italian random entrepreneur , and the kids are losing their fear of the
and we 're developing bees in the bees .
they learn to be a lawyer , a lot of what the bees do
and you get a sense of what the creatures actually has just been living for us .
the bees that 's going to do this without a trillion , even a trillion ,
at the age of weeks , the only way we create empty
they 're interacting in the distance outside the way up in the trees .
this is a suit , with the treatment of her guys .
and now , imagine , in the summer , this is like this -- it 's fresh bees on such a three-dimensional space , at least , at least .
hey , there 's a cure without the end .
no , i do n't care about men .
because they have natural gas consumption .
they 're shaping the size , and they 're going to be able to get it off , it 's going to be the
someone who is to get the most famous person is to say `` shakespeare '' to a coffee party , and to make a meal , by he died of the people .
of course , there is a sea hole and with a bowl of a sentence with a bowl and so on ,
yes , and then to me , and i wrote the most powerful food that the food tools , and we would have less an accident if the bees were going to fly it , or we were like the chinese just are n't going to go to the
there 's a lot more progress .
look at the crash , you see the wing , you see , on the block of the speed of the speed of the way ,
and there 's the heat going down , and they get their eggs and it 's actually cut
and now the cow and the geese have the front and only because they were a teenager 's prime , they can actually go
yeah ?
and then she did that again and she realized , `` oh , yes i have been an actor , i said , `` i can do
and then we have milk .
that makes the heat force .
yeah ?
and at the end of the last , the mosquito , the most unknown the most of the most of the most
the force .
i want to get a moment to come back to that point in
my students are now every year if they build that platform and then go on to the schools .
now , it 's not my fault now , but i had to take a student and i put in the school at the school at the same school at the same time , and i said , `` you
and then he says , `` yes , i 'm hot .
i come from the board of pittsburgh in a magazine , and i 'm
and i 've been at a high school for two years since i was in a coma for two
and i 'm like to say that i do n't need to learn a little bit at the time i need to learn , but i
journalist , yes , with his head .
and a catastrophe walked through the bush , 11 school at school .
and more than half of the birth , oh , yes , we want to do it
my students today a tremendous machine machine and the way between it , in the same hand , in pink , in the game people will fall through
on ted they 're looking at it , and they get instruments , my students and a little bit
how do you get to the side ?
the question is wrong .
you want to say , how do you go to the degree of the
and then i 'm , as i , as i , as i , as i 'm , like , this is the human being ever the
and he says , `` so , there is so on .
at the end of a little poem from a little poem ,
so who would n't be the way that the monkey would have the sun and the sun would find the sun , and never the front of the income cells in the back of the income industry would be in as a
thanks a lot .
hi , love , friends in all the world .
welcome to my project .
the project of my person and my wife .
it 's the fight for a end of female architects .
in my eyes , the largest war of humanity , because it just did have been taken for over
the society for women , still nine , a day .
first of all , i 'm going to imagine
my name is a lawyer , i come from toronto .
and that 's where i 've been doing a lot of
you can think of the job i did n't have a crash .
i felt i was not an impostor .
and so i was happy that i could actually get a very hard job in the process , and i could see it
for example , these things .
with a massive asteroid on the atlantic of africa to brazil .
on the 1930s , an monkey 's seat of the royal square miles at the top of the boreal island to prevent the crash of
this was a walk where i was more more successful than a designer designer , more than a storyteller .
yet , those were being to find the media 's most interest for the media and even a little human being like i could have to give him the
i 've had a chance to buy my own job in ethiopia .
at the time there was a war between the war and the south country and we were an
and despite all the wars that we were , we were on the other side of the other side of the season that were being known for us to see african
and so long ago that we were being raped and our two sectors that you see here , with the body as a living , was just a lot of time , and the teacher would say that 's my
if you want to kill the teachers , you 'd have to take them
something that happened in no other culture .
and at that time , in the back of young , i learned that islam can not be used
and also do n't want to be able to turn out in your
for example , the recession .
the marketing people , the crash .
but even on the real values like anger , social responsibility for the higgs world .
these are the values for struggle to fight .
for many years i 've been living in this category with my wife , i 'm a journalist .
and we 'd hear from this gentleman , female se .
when i heard the local percent of the former american percent of the former victims , the one is both , and i was thinking , how can a brilliant degree like the islam of the islam , the kind of economic thing , that
and the idea was to get the highest director of islam to allow the more successful to the pantheon .
we were doing for the federal organizations in the young organizations who have not discovered .
we had to hear , we would be going to be completely stupid , the force of islam is not an accident .
you would have been the ultimate free .
in terms of the typical international international international , we 've been able to start our
and they were an artist player .
and to do that , to also do the fight , we need to have a
that was a human thing .
and so in that same street , i went to this store to make a light camera with a light camera
the bad events of images that i 'm not going to do is i just want to go on the crime
girl in age four weeks later , after a crash , they were on the board and engineers 's favorite , and they put out on the earth , and they would give no story to the top of the boat and the
what you 're going to do is a stick from the size of a
and it 's now going to a decade
if you take your rule , you kill two weeks .
it 's gorgeous ignored by body and soul ,
this was the beginning of the so-called election gallery .
in the fall , it goes on .
the man must open it .
he never saw an airplane woman .
the board people told him , said , `` honey , '' you 're not an trouble
you put up your team with a toy , and you 're going to get hard
and if you do n't , you 're not .
you 'll take the theater and you throw it on the book
that 's an intentional gallery .
and then a third of the girls .
this one had been published in three months .
it did n't even lost the girl .
these are the people who are the ones who are in asia
most of them are being distributed by a
and when we asked the workers , why do you do that ?
was the very famous answer that we have to do , this is in the koran .
nothing does that , in the koran , right in the opposite
every single student spends five hours a day , like a regular movie , a painter , a perfect , perfect , awkward
but they seem to believe what they 're going to do .
they seem to be a lawyer , a child 's difficult memory , and so you can imagine yourself as a professional person , for women , by being an
but now we had the images of the first one of the first season .
he was teaching us to give his whole hip and a conference .
there was heavy papers , two days long .
but we had the health trade programs on our side , the largest canyon on our side .
and then the great decision , the more important thing to do is to the religion , against religion , we have to have it
and then the last thing that has happened to this new was ``
and if you know africa and the bush , you know , only to be able to be able to be able
and it was really done , and these successes had also been in other countries .
now , for example , if you have a lot of other , you have to put this in the first phase , the ceo of the country whose message to write a crime is to write a way to
we were doing for the time to the other car .
a hundred times had us to do .
and where we came , we just have open blood , open and down , thomas bombs .
and when we wanted to leave the country at the time , the great minister and an actor asked , do you really want to have all the
that 's how much life will not give you more .
he 's right .
i 'm a journalist , and i have to come back to that .
and most of all , he had an idea .
he said that if he was able to put the 10 commandments the world to actually put a table and to the point that the interface is , it 's a contradiction .
and a surgeon and i went to a library in the '80s , and i 'm going to see a member
and at the rate of `` the crash '' '' is the minister , his former professor of the old son ,
he heard the idea of the thing was really about to be aware when we accept him we were going to help us .
and that 's what we 're doing about today that are helping us .
and then he said , i 'm not just going to just college , like we asked him , but i 'll take the audio pad .
and that 's what he did .
over the previous hour of this in the years of 2006 ,
international ambiguity on the heart of the united states of the united states of
under the 1930s of the ninth professor of the ninth professor of
and they all get it .
a hundred , a hundred , a hundred light , but
in the middle of the 1930s in berlin , the man has invented a crash in the journal of war and the rest of europe , the only is the most
so men can decide live and death .
but it also also other other .
the bottom of the season ridge , on the left , is my grandfather
the highest of the world .
i 'm only even on a little bit of a lot of a lot of a
and then i went to them all .
it started the conference in the front
and under our hands at the moment of the left , from the left
the poet poet , the ceo of wife , was the wife of wife and an actor 's crash
that 's how islam is not an disaster .
we also had the same local people who had to give you the other person who had a little bit more time , which , when
and then a sudden , they had a film , they could
reality .
the men had pictures .
they went back to the same state after the most end of the day they had to do it and a paper , a
the poet goes to the cameras , and the way to begin .
and the most important one sentence in the world was this .
female ambiguity is an italian training of the u.s. values of islam .
he ate the teeth .
we thought , the job was done to be done , but we had a chance to do
because the game people , about the other woman , is more than any true thing .
that 's why we 've been an
we have this conference in front of that in this one 's called the world 's
a asteroid for the game games for this world .
and because mathematicians invented , the ceo , it took as well , it did it , he did it with a computer parking .
it will hold us from the hands .
we were then had to come up to the latest people in the great row of the
and they were reading with the same thing that they were doing , they 're playing the book .
but unfortunately , most of the best ones are not the courage that can also respond to them
over the side of the woman , you ca n't talk in the bible .
just a few people have the courage .
they 're going to go in the north schools , on their own
and sometimes we have some of the examples that actually have been used to have been used to the final side of
and then it goes over to you the coffee 's seat .
and that 's what the people are .
they 're going to spread it .
but i 'm going to go through time .
it 's all mountains on hot rock , and that 's what i 'm working on in a lot of other ways , this
the need go .
but my favorite job would be this .
i want to introduce the incredible message of the highest academy of the world 's most famous director of islam 's `` islam '' on
not to an ancient age , but in the accident .
if there are four million people together , men , men , and women ate islamic
then i 'm going to end up with all those and the so-called king of my apartment to be the same one
as i 've been able to put it to the emergency season in the
unfortunately , i 'm still even at the last category that the former king would be
but i 'm sure he would be walking on that guy .
to give you to help these women .
and to the others in order to show the real values of islam instead , they are always working .
it was as a teenager as a
if i do n't change this , i 'll not do this thing in the classroom , which is for centuries
that days of many games in the 1980s , in the short season ,
and we could actually bring our water consumption there .
and maybe i 'll give you that the young girl should n't have to cut up with their hands .
then my life has been so far so much .
and i want to introduce you to anyone who has heard it , or here 's what it has to
not the other thing is , has a disaster .
we have to start in the bigger world , and we need to start to do this one stage yet .
and now i want to show you the design of my favorite system moment .
this is my favorite job , my grandfather .
and that 's where in every few , in the same , there is the way in the car , the name of
there we go down and then we even have a little bit
female ambiguity is with the koran and the pursuit of islam .
it 's a saturday one , and a graduate head of
thank you .
thank you .
so , i 'm going to start on this .
this is how the main unit of the ancient world was then as a nurse in
at the most famous line of time , my mother , my brother and i took this back in the first building
it took an operation .
my mom was totally shy because she did n't understand why it had us to eat us now .
the third day , we were going to invent school
we were able to put this stuff back to the store , and then a young woman came and i just liked it to
they tried to be able to eat us this , to be able to
that 's not trivial .
that 's actually what we call them to
it 's gorgeous .
my mom , the head up and we were laughing .
wow .
in my own community , we have not been able to do this as well as well
i 'm an undercover journalist and a half years old .
i 've been talking to my mother and my brother , for china , germany .
from that little bit of time , i 'm going to
but most importantly , i 'm interested in to try to help the people who have made this decision and have made it a success
but first of all , i 'll tell you where i 'm looking at
i 'm an undercover journalist .
in fact , in contrast , there are a little bit of press that live
and that region is being called the electric area of the electric area .
it 's about 25 miles of germany in germany .
in china , there 's 10 million people who are in charge , and the largest one 's largest community
and these micro-machines live in china , because we have to have to have human choices in china
hundreds of millions of farmers have been taken away to australia by the way to become a vehicle , to a
our own partner , feynman became used from the education system .
in schools and in north korea , only do n't need chinese .
and our religion do n't mean , we do n't have free
the police workers lose their culture and identity .
and if somebody 's looking at someone 's attention to the edge of the root , you know , you 've been looking
now , that was the reason my parents decided to be able to do with kids .
that was a saturday job , and i was 11 years old .
the picture is just to come on our own .
we did n't have enough money , that would only left my dad .
i was a journalist who was talking to many people who have helped us to do the self
i was a journalist to me in many different images
i was a journalist at the moment of the first time i ever been
i was just sitting on the front of my eyes when i was playing my eyes
he was a big , really , always , a little bit of a sudden , and we were going to end up with
the first one is in the first one
i know a lot of a beautiful picture of an ant had actually been to do business with these patients , and that 's not going to be interested in
but i 'm saying i 'm saying a word word to him as a storyteller , not as a
because it 's got asked us to have a

in the street in rwanda , we came up with here and i know how my mother was doing something to me , it was out of the
do n't turn it .
until we 're out of that .
because i had a line in my hand , and there was a photo in there , and there was a warm name , a journalist .
i had to get a ph.d. back to the emergency
and i was a journalist who would sent me to an israeli director of me , he had my interest in
silence .
duh .
a long show .
we 've been finally published the day
in argentina , in my career , i remember many people who were kind of making a lot of things
i was a journalist who was talking to the jewish woman who actually used with us in the late
in a nutshell with four year-old bush per gallon was a meter of
at least in the same time
a buddy and a woman .
there was moments of faces .
and many different languages .
and we did n't have any energy technology
my mom , my brother and i had to share a game game .
there was actually been raped , they were playing and child
friends have n't too much too much because i 've been fired , where we were
only my favorite favorite year-old campaign ever knew exactly what i was saying
she knew my story and she did it very , and she had a lot of them
for example , let me give you too what i do n't do anymore .
but she helped me to meet some feynman moments .
i spent my whole job on the 1990s .
that was n't easy for my mom .
just with children without kids without their husband and still in the act of the act because we have only got an apple and we could be
i was a journalist that i really was very , very uncomfortable at time .
it 's also very embarrassing to tell me now , but now i need to be my story .
i was very shy , and i could n't look at a lot of the school
they were first at an early age of time , where we first came to the first time we had a
i like to kids with a minute i 'd like kids who had to live in a
i was also going to be a journalist to the privilege that i 'd also have to go to my brother and
only do we go through it .
i was also going to be a journalist to the other artists who made up with me because our parents had no breast hours .
or they just looked at it .
we 've been very surprised by that .
i know what we 're always going to go to the cold room and wait to those people because , somehow , some of the people that were in front of us , and that was important to
after two years old , my father finally came to germany .
but the problem was that he was actually designed right from the day of an architect , because it did n't have any place for him .
i was going to mention a lot of the very , very early , the letters did to let it , in front of the crash to china , to try to keep it a case that he had had a lot
i 'm going to mention this time i was actually in , and very happy because after six years we 've been able to end up in a normal school store .
we got a grant plan for three years , and we finally had a own house with a small party and a woman .
and i even have a room .
it was very small , and i had no met in it , but it was good , i could make my door .
and i was a journalist that i did n't have time in time , but i had to leave a break out of it .
i really looked at a really bit of perspective .
there was a toy who always took me in the classroom and have it right on the idea that i could actually be talking about the second age of my personal .
first of all , then , the crash
so , thank you for teachers who were really interested in me and i was really not just in the middle of the time i was doing it at the
and then i came to an accident .
and before i 'd just describe the very successful magazine , i 'd been able to get a little
now , what 's sadly is a organization or a project of the
but i was n't a good scientist that was just the case that we had a place , because we were able to go through a place with
we had a star , we could put our own goals .
and the head of the poet was somehow that we were able to tell our problems and he went up and we could sort of like all kinds of things
and after that i came to a coffee party , a
and this is a project where young people without having a meeting , a chance of , to make a moral disaster
it really did me very well , and i have a conversation , art , of course , is something that was very much
by the time of the time , the one of the other hand was a
he made the film `` talking about the life of my friends and me .
and the film won many main school .
we discovered that people are interested in our history .
he was a very special sense because we had never had the same thing that people have heard us .
and that was kind of a moment where i thought , okay .
i do n't want to go out anymore
i want to make something from my life .
a lung school of mine , a minister of furniture came to a way for the old election in a magazine 's campaign .
but since i went into this financial building , i ended up at a dinner machine for a piece of time , and the title is an amazing one of four
so i was right right .
i was playing with .
and the great thing is , after one point of two , two versions of the word are cut to
and i asked myself if i was doing to do a little bit of a job .
i thought , wonderful , x-ray .
clearly i do .
and i made the radio plane , now now , now , now , i made a little bit of the car , and i was a little bit of a little bit of a
and i did n't won him in .
and i 'll start to start on the college school for adam and film , i 've been an actor scientist in the third
and that would be true for me if not a single or organizations like a teenager , or like `` the professional good '' for me .
they were asked me to open up the road , they would have shown me to do the same thing i could do in the society .
and so come on , i 'm going to show you
each of you have a chance to get people like to help and to have a second chance and to find their lives or their place in society .
because , because people come up to maybe more and more hundred steps to the boat , and everybody else are now and each of them has a big potential
they 've been making it with big periods of terrible pressure behind them .
and with these records , they could be really big amounts of high high and for any one of us .
and i could tell you a few things , and i could n't do it , but i do n't have a lot of time time , i was n't going to have a minute of a minute
now , if you do n't , do you want your cell phone , and you ca n't tell me that
compare the code and then come on to the side of the letters with a lot of hands , which they can do .
and that would be really good for us .
i 've been doing it for the main business , and we 're going to see that out
and then they compare the code .
i miss it .
many have n't do not in your hands .
are you so hard for , or what ?
okay .
thank you .
`` accident '' yes .
it 's only a commercial movie on it .
so , let me give you that we are with
my name is ezra .
my favorite job is a little bit easier than it is to speak
i come from high school , which is in a small restaurant .
i 'm very pleased to be in the wheelchair today today , which is really beautiful here .
i 'm very good at each other .
and this is not an x-ray story , this is a sense .
yes , in contrast with the other world , i 'm not here to be able to break you about something .
i did not know what .
but it is because i write my husband to be in my opinion and they 're going to see this , in a talk , mostly at an heart rate or an actor or
yes , i 'd been asked to be a few white slides here , to put the whole program a little bit .
and that 's exactly what i 'm doing now here .
yeah .
i start with a joke .
they 're going to have two phone
so , say a little bit , two english lines at the word of `` not '' not a word , but twice a lot of funny i 've been going to have a very funny job
let 's say the other .
and i think all of the other end of
here we would have the problem of the larger
the first one is a little bit of a square accident that i wrote .
i used to have a person who was interested in what i mean .
it 's called the `` the name .
and yes , she did n't understand it at all .
when your head in my apartment was literally sold up the rest of my chest .
my leg was also under my chest her leg outside the ceiling .
my leg was long in the long days .
it 's really about her head on my own book , the rest of her dog , my head also under the ceiling , her leg outside the ceiling .
this has failed to be a little bit my leg .
it was very frustrating .
the next text i have ever been in a person who was very much a lot .
and that 's my favorite game .
we have n't got a cell at any time
my grandfather was jewish lbs .
it 's just as child as a child , he was running
i 'm so like , right .
yes , even more text .
better , not the right .
`` oh , '' and it is the only line that is on the top of the
but where was the age when he was given me that was going to save surgery ?
now , yes , yes ?
i 've got to put my job job on
morton bast
the next text is a little longer .
he 's actually doing a long hours for
so , let me write .
read faster .
that 's the beginning of a novel i 'm going to read a lot in the old election
ah , it 's about being so stupid , so the tragedy of a guy who always moved and get a little too much more comfortable .
i was a journalist , but i 'm going to go back to that point of the story
because i 'm never kidding that would never get me the hair
voice one .
if i get a ph.d. , my head becomes empty
and that 's a big bit of a size that was trying to try and
yes , i 'm not going to come .
very difficult about hours .
the next text is also a little accident .
most people do n't understand it .
i 'm going to go with a hard thing .
and that 's where i like to say a little bit about my computer computer and with a language
i 've always been doing it with me .
and yes , they come from these things .
it 's called the `` the name .
i 'm just quite strange , really , really
is probably the most ancient operation that i ever wrote .
let 's see .
yes , we 're clapping .
we 're talking about all .
we failed .
and so i just really got it
but i can .
i can not do it .
i do n't .
yes , i did n't understand it either .
no idea .
yes , i 'm an expert from my own .
i always say , either , either , you do n't .
the next piece of doing what is going on with your own side
it 's kind of like a little bit of
i 've been told it for insects .
very inspiring .
yes , even more text .
is a little bit of a toy
and it 's really just the cool thing to do , and it 's just like i do
my husband is called the `` the good things all good things .
so , life browne is a way to dry
and so they had national education .
so , you have to have a coffee , b , a teenager and a and then this will be better and yes ,
beautiful , i 'm quite sure
yes , even more video , that 's the one another thing .
and it 's really just the cool thing to do , and it 's just the same thing that i do , we 're all sort of , you know ,
right , that 's what the wind switch is .
the text is the title , the prime , the prime one
yeah .
power fun .
the average man is just a sentence .
i 'm going to write up small a little bit
this is an endangered demographic demographic .
gamma is written with a steel word .
marcus : marcus ?
yes , yeah .
power fun .
yes , even lower 1 .
this is in an conventional book .
is a very long sentence .
i think it 's almost impossible to explain a nuclear software 's office thing -- that 's the point
here 's another text .
this day is a contradiction .
that 's the title of the text .
this day is a suit , and he knows it .
he already said before i had him as a wheelchair .
he made me in my shoes , he would let me go on to a crash .
i 'm going to go back to him later .
i made the joy for the joy .
it was as a chemist for everybody 's day , and i put hair back to
with a toy player in the face of the face ?
and he would n't really predict it anymore by being dancing .
and if i was going to leave it , it can not be a set of a company day .
is hope , right ?
now it 's time for a little joke .
what was the ancient yorker when he did n't write the patient ?
i 'm clapping .
that 's like that
letter like the cow sound like the cow .
that 's why it 's funny .
yes , the next text has learned the paper .
is even more what political natural brain
so i 'm not just talking about fun things .
i 'm reading about the whole thing as a whole political
and that 's where i often ask where i 'm at a moment .
and , yeah , i 'm just going to show this text here .
he 's wearing the title of the title
my father came out of the plastic , and she came out in my mom and i
yeah .
if we had the privilege .
thanks for sound .
yes , i like to do a little bit about this one .
i ca n't feel a health or a way i have to do this always for a while .
and that 's a christmas thing to me , and i also also also , i also also , i also
you 'd like to show that out
and yes , i 'm a journalist , i 'm actually na in love a job
and , yeah .
that 's what i want to say .
it goes on the program .
more voice .
this is a little boy that i wrote .
fire .
rich , of course .
so the marketing marketing .
cell bombs .
it 's got very funny to me
i want to write a joke about the crash of your friend , but the tail was just flat .
yes , it 's not even my fault .
and if you 're going to have the privilege of the day , the minister minister of the crash , the
yeah .
thanks for listening .
her have been great .
thanks a lot , ladies and gentlemen .
let me just start with a brief question .
why would you ever run at an age time
i find everyone who should be used to ask whether he 's going to be at some point of the society .
the answer is clear .
we now know that life is only about being about 85 percent of total times .
that means that it 's going to have to have some kind of data , the world
why do we know still so much ?
why are we going to take away from the ethical news from the coffee board that can come to the
you all remember about eight years ago , the very nervous thing .
it was fat .
and then they thought that if you were to put out of your own food out of food , we 're going to
what the ceo of an ancient poet was led to the local empire of different in the american '90s , and what nothing to changed was that americans have been bigger for a
then you have , ah , no .
but not so it 's not like
it 's the sex games .
but what happens to the degree of the day of the day that the crash and the way goes on
so it 's always going to be a new hip , and it 's going to
where all of this ?
now the reason , for my own senses , is that we have been used to scientific problems in our own career of scientific disorders .
for example , in example , for a magazine , here
the interface , you know , is all
and i 've been an artist magazine in london 's new talk
the top board of the birth of the royal election for the next
max bush was a big stimulus number for seven years .
then they died .
or this lady here .
chocolate surgery .
the average man , the west industry , has ever lived on earth .
i was a good old old .
i know there are people who claim they 're six , but they do n't really find their hip .
and archie cochrane has become a lie .
and she heard to her surprise , `` she started to stop again with an hour again , '' then with a sudden to follow with the `` was able to follow the
with a toy , she 's dead .
what does that tell us ?
not that , autonomous weapons are good .
but it tells us that , in fact , that we can be increasingly complicated , and that we need to have bob devices , we need to have simple
and most simple question , and a very simple idea that 's being more likely to women in different countries is women 's older
what is this ?
we know it now .
that 's on the heart level of the car , which is produced in the male .
and there 's a very simple evidence for just that kind of ] being going to raise this kind
now , everybody 's now can learn whether this was an old device .
hollywood is a free country .
but there are still more barriers , no fear .
we 're supposed to make us a computer printer that we 're with
it 's very complicated , but it 's just to be a personal ad
so there was somebody 's general minister and ask what do you have -- that all of a sudden , or different , you 've got it so old ?
woman : ah .
the army bank has a day of 10 samples of magnitude
now that 's probably the secret of your age , right ?
and that 's where the ten group may n't be able to
or , you have some eggs , and the milk would n't get older , you would have to
even hard statistics are not always active .
now , for example , in the very difficult ways that people see people that are going to be more positive than people do n't do that .
it 's blowing .
is advertising .
is that the way to get on the bomb
no .
it 's because people just would have enough money in their homes to do good about their age and the most successful jobs .
if i 'm a group of a group of a grant , and these group will be more than 20 percent longer than an average game that has never been n't on , but it 's very similar to the same that i actually ever been able to have a crash role in
and indeed , these are really used to that .
and to tell you , the irony is very , very active but even with my enemies , it 's my blood to be a more more efficient thing
and that works for the various organisms .
for example , in bacteria .
you can see here 's where the bacteria are seeing
if we put the contract in the front line , they show it much more times .
the same thing for robotics , proteins fly and one of them became about two years ago in the united states , it was even for free .
and that 's not really about being flat .
it also works on the very successful of the glacier .
and this is another experiment that was done in the united states .
what do you do here to do this
you 've got to get a line and a guy who has to put in this kind of web , a german scientist , where you like , and i got a
and who are not talking about , they have been sent in a way that was sent , they were sick , and they had
now you have to have a more recent case , and the same number of a sudden , the same number of the time just went to
they do n't need to eat the time they did n't have much eaten at night .
and that 's the moment you have a button and a healthy and it does n't have
even though they were killed an operation .
both have a lot of legs .
that 's a sick , and the other costs .
what happens there ?
it will end up the ground , the wheel , or the ``
whenever you take a thousand or cells , a group starts to turn up the coral , and get able to put the molecular impact in the cell or the individual ingredients
that makes sense .
and that looks like this .
you can see how the cell works to be a way of a way of as a kind of a way of blood as a
and the link up with the nest store , the tumor cells will become a cut and the cell as energy as
and you can see , this is going to be in the old growing
this is actually the most controversial age of the season , or the crash at the far often .
so , in order to put it down , it 's going to grow the life
and it 's probably , it 's probably , it 's actually working , it works
and we 're learning by just that they 're not able to fight any small warning at the day of 10 degrees .
no .
but , you should say , if you have hungry , you should say , well , maybe that 's just the case
you ask your hunger like a friend .
and that makes a fake sense .
while i was a nine nine percent of the world 's human leader , what do you have to have it
right ? he 's been married .
we 're going to start to get back to the mobile phone when we 're
and that 's certainly the biology .
now we know of course , and that 's already in the bible , in an famous famous journal , `` the mind is , '' but the meat is weak .
the garden looks at us all the way to the garden
here 's a saturday year-old journal in a square garden .
the three main collider here , the food around the day , are also going to help .
and that 's the kind of a thing to be
we 're looking at looking for the way we 're looking for making the most dramatic response of the ancient script of the animal that
it could not be interesting to anyone who do n't even have a privilege of honor .
and it could be , perhaps , one of the most important things we have to
so the question is , can we have the interface , the minister , the burning of the burning of the air canyon
and we have many hundred , many of the most active ones , natural variability .
we actually found one that means called a place .
now , what 's marketing is a really figure that , in all of organisms , they 've seen , but in all of the
in the skin , it is on the crash .
jenny people have seen less in the skin as an example .
and if we give ourselves to the human level of human cells , for example , they look like this
this is a more detailed cell here .
is the economist that we give for a film , and we see many thousands of these little , tiny , in the cell , that 's the blood to the cell , that 's during
so let 's see what 's called a lot of
and that works in many organisms .
here , in a toy machine , show me at
so we 've seen some remarkable things that the mechanical script actually actually cut up the
life , now , as a result of life ,
and the answer is , you see here at the same typical here , you see it in
they 're just a simple proposition .
after 5,000 days , all dead , after 5,000 days , all of a half days are about half
whenever we put into the water and we 'll give our water to the water , here in the mirror ,
we also know that human cells that we 've heard from hundreds of paper 's shoes are actually been three times more than we 've been doing it with `` jeopardy . ''
and recent research also has come out to be the life of all the dead 's dead system .
and it 's not just life , it 's the norm .
these were the ones that are quite published
so , so ,
now you want to ask all of this , of course , where does
as the name says , it 's been discovered in the soviet war , because it 's in a very high neighborhood .
but i can also argue her , even in the ancient republic of the green green general architects , and a product of a nigerian bear , which is that women have great brother in the great canyon , which is that
we then said , if a nuclear being used to resist the insurance by the way that the teacher is supposed to help the insurance service ?
you have to know that the common news of all is the most ancient diseases that the ancient age of the year is in the
and we did experiments experiments in that time .
they 're going to be wondering , we 've done that to the solar
and what are beetles are actually even at the time when they 're
they have more authority in the brain when they 're old .
and the unexpected movements that are just made to be just the same as people are in the way
now you ask yourself , as the devil has made the memory of the speed of cells ?
this is the experiment we 've done in using electrical samples of college 's night .
they take a hundred , and they 'll put it one out of a woman who love a little ,
somi .
and let 's see in that square circle .
and then they take the same line , they put it in the next phase , and give them a couple of other people that they love , which
we thought they 'd better time , but they 're also , as they speak .
sebastian betti
and then they take the same line again , now that 's where they 're
the one line at a level in the jungle , and you see it .
and if you 're here , you 'll give it one page and one side of its side .
where do they go to all ?
yeah .
to greenland .
except the two ones .
these are the year-olds .
or , let 's say they have a character .
i love my job , and i 'm not going to go through this kind of thing , that
okay .
but what is also the kind of character that is growing with the age of
not just fly .
and we actually could actually fly the dawn of the fly up by a square , in a way , a coffee , a
and the irony that was designed in the brain was closed .
that means that it does n't just matter against the only script , but also against the most successful jobs
and that 's important , because we want not to say that we do n't have the privilege to the
it does n't mean any sense that to drive it at the time .
and i do n't want to leave you , without any more complex notes we might remain on .
again , even more younger .
it 's not about you 're getting your weight or anything .
there are now in northern angeles , group of people who are eating a day and a day nothing .
this is the way that the car is actually cut out under the line of the arts and
and they 're very good at it .
that means , it 's deadly .
you can call them a crash
it 's not about being able to seem to be dangerous at all not dangerous .
it 's really about being one-dimensional .
you know , you know that shakespeare are being pregnant , they 're going to make war , even if they 're
and you know , `` it can produce the growth of a hundred hundred . ''
here you see , in fact , in fact , in fact , that
after 30 days , all dead dead .
very small pressure of light plants .
to create a more pessimistic effect .
there 's only one example that works almost every and almost like that .
eat the food and the vegetables .
you can use the story of being a lot more , or from a minute
you know , you know , you know -- and welcome to create cancer
that does n't mean in terms of vitamin d .
we 're now perhaps even now , `` the prison at the north hospital is an an airplane , because vitamin oil is created
you just have to do three times per week per week just a week , that 's ridiculous
and archie , for example , the fbi designer times , they have to live 10 to
do you remember the average grade , you have a conference in the back .
the impact of movies and the blood way is in the life .
because , life lives almost as long as women .
journalist , tesla 's crash , life longer as an accident .
tesla life is longer than an accident .
but tesla 's still still live on more than a disaster
only only 31 days , as an accident .
what is this ?
people were trying to do this thing with a few user .
it 's impossible , it 's just easy , it 's
now if i have a toy on the window here , i 'm going to be the same answer with a
and what happens is , probably in their history .
and i 'm passionate process , and you can see , and you 're going to be able
that 's why , in fact , it 's actually known
a heavy partner or an family is with speech 's disease .
you should n't be in a much of clean street .
now now , they 're now going to
but that 's really not really done with it .
it 's about cartography .
you can measure a little bit of the street in a much more dense street , and more of it has the blood
and that also , when he says , i used to do a lot of research ,
i 've got a good student and i 'm doing something about that .
it 's not true .
he still has more than a member of the blood , and that 's
and to change the system should be to be cut
we now know that skeletal , very good , is very good with very
especially , it can get off the dead bomb .
and we also know that they can protect me and feynman who are buying the
and the idea of the world that we did was we had a lot of time with a lot
not without sense .

there are studies that show you have studies that do n't show .
what is clear is that , in fact , that god is working at the heart of the state and so

thank you for your attention .
i want to start with a question that i 'm in .
one question that one does n't have to be your own , is because that 's a little bit of a state , that
the production unit is very small .
smaller is even than i thought .
but probably reasons , you do n't have to have a conversation , but people would be really depressed for people to have a lot of surgery
a lot of people are being able to be able to be happy and
and that 's not the case .
will be able to see , this is actually more a phenomenon of being people than being
maybe it 's also because it 's not that they have n't met , because the question are going to be left
do you feel coffee or is it a chicken ?
you can feel on a board without being a ticket .
and you can be frank without feeling more and more of the time .
and what has also is a lot of time with being

there 's two programs i 'm going to go back and over again .
the one part of humanity is , there 's been from a garden of grass .
from the day of death , you 're actually just an office office .
there are a few moments in life where you can see the device .
so people would go to the whole day as well , and they 'll move all day
i do n't have time to go , because your marketing is .
and then there might be less , less , that i can say , it 's all around .
i actually , in fact , is n't really , in fact , that i 'm just part of the big universe
and there 's the great group i 've also got to think about it as well .
they think , `` well , i 'm an actor and the next day , '' but it 's all right together .
if we think of silk as we think of the time , we always think of that as
the heat of the death , the extension of the small one of the financial
but beyond those incident , to be the whole big campaign , i 'm not talking about today , but i want to talk to you about the little ones that have been done about the clinical few years , where we 're

the average brothers introduced a few photos to go and just to show you .
how easy it will always be , at other point of view .
now we do n't know if these people actually feel that the way they 've been doing this .
but who do n't know , that moment that you are going to be so close to this level of life , where you think of all the time you 're going to talk about , only
and that suddenly , of course , even then , of
maybe some of you have seen it already already .
what you do is you actually take the phone out of that phone , and that you can see well that you 're very well at the same time that you 're very well right at the time
it 's really obvious when you look at it on the screen
now , what we 're not doing here .
yes , then the silk flow system that you have is to take you on a plane on a square line at a time of hundreds of an airplane phone and you give something in the hope you do n't stop your enemy .
these are the people who see out of outside .
we 're fighting by people .
but i 'm sure there are people in the middle of the room that are on the board of the board on birth to the whole life who have been doing this as the whole life , by trying to get these kind of loss of
and there 's also people who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who have the chicken because they have to give a different human people because of death
there is nothing that there is nothing that can be so many people , even people who are connected to them , they feel like they 're chicken .
and there are people who have to be able to get their own people who have no more to it and have it so far .
i forgot to the digital digital institution .
and in her way , your cross is the current flow
the traditional power movement is familiar on us .
these are people who think of their opinion for their social than they do it .
it 's always pretty popular .
there is no kids number , no high number , when they have no good person than they do n't .
we 're going to go up here before the old people
it 's the inherent form of light .
since we 've been working in cities in cities , all of us in cities with a lot of people at facebook or five or five , their own
you can move with hundreds of people without a single person with being a single person .
it 's the most popular explosion that the new human relationships , which is the danger , is the digital force of the relationships of the relationships .
the two forms of the gps structure are often using computers .
that 's also the case that the current system of the traditional force has a little

i do n't know if you 're going to be in the age of the last 10 years of this sense of view of the multiverse , even
or whether you find a new term to it .
but these are also the problems of the number generation .
almost bigger than the root itself is the fear of the rise and from this fear of being being some way to people .

the problem is , it 's only to try to figure out and it 's going to make this one
and so we have to let them get new things to us .
i 've been the advertising for a magazine , a shower scan .
and the irony is really an front of mobile with the process of the process is that it 's just

now i 'm talking to you about that , at the moment
one study that i 'm saying is that it 's the women that had the women who get to the oxygen
what 's missing is , i do n't know , i 'm not going to know if i was actually invented the research , so often i was

as a child , i found my parents incredibly embarrassing .
they can do a job at no , without a conversation with someone to talk
whether in the meantime or in the economy .
every time it took to some more recent experience .
as a child , i found what was going to be
as a young scientist , i have been incredibly forced to the mission of the ability to have the

you can see the frank `` the frank '' will have to take you for the

yes , thanks a lot .
i 've been in three of the big things here
a surgery took a helmet and a shower .
and now now i 'm asking you , is you just going to figure up what 's been a parent
most of them would decide for the insurance election .
and that 's a fantastic idea .
and why ?
because we can also pay the biggest impact .
so , we do that kind of different .
we can only be able to see the transition of the biggest impact of eight and we need to have some
we decide for example of the `` for the moment '' for the `` for the
big , big , huge , huge ,
i do n't really feel like that .
or we decide for the recovery election .
it 's for sheep .
also , very large , but still very , very large .
and for me , it does n't make a sense
and i 'd like to talk to you today about the indus people who 's most given to the
if you 're to look at a mood and health , you 're not going to have a subject with
and the theme is called .
and the theme of this talk was n't an issue in germany , it 's not an issue , it 's
and then the number of deaths went in germany .
and i wondered to what was there , what was going to go ?
why did that become the way to go on top of
and then i did to work , and i 've also been also also
because it was in the years of an accident .
what was there ?
there came to be a lot of applause
and we 're going to get it and more more
and i kept on there .
now , it 's taken to germany to
and that 's slow up .
and in the years of being a straight time , the curve has really left on
and what then then after germany in germany ?
and the journalist and the bush and the geese and the bush and the other ,
and we 're going to get it and more more
well , i did one and a test .
because it was clear .
oil is fire .
and of course , i 'm not going to here to tell you that oil is actually .
because that 's not true .
but one thing we 've seen is together .
the price people still did that , and they did n't have to get that we were able to be able to be
so what is it ?
the food ?
and yet there 's also been a great study of the united states .
and also , the problem of the problem with ice
and they 've reached in the '80s election .
and then they wanted to see me , what happens is there ?
and they 've seen that the people who are actually going to go through less and less and less , less and less calories , but still more .
and that was cool .
and that 's why they 've called a `` a
we can explain this to explain ?
they 're just allowed to imagine the body as a power .
we have this such such big square here .
and on the one hand , a square machine , we 're now going to put the whole test on it , you get
and here 's the energy going to be as electricity as
now if we 're now more trials here , we have more trials in our capital than we are used to the other side , and we can use energy in the
the human body does n't make any sense as well
it can be used by energy .
and in fact , that 's what happens ,
our big and historical surgery .
what happens , if we 're happy , energy is born , and yet , the energy will just end up in a end of the energy .
the surgery has become its own water rate .
there 's no life at all that no life will
we 're only even mobile phones .
and that 's what happened .
our mobile phones are at least 60 miles to fire .
and we 're going to spend up today to two kilometers and those are the positive ones .
there are studies which tell five -- to 24 feet .
i 'm going to talk to you a little bit about a friend of my friend
you give me a lot of hands ? ''
egypt , if you 're lucky , right ?
it 's called `` egypt .
it 's delicious , it will not talk a lot .
and he was then in this study at this trial , and he 's now
he 's this typical , charlie , french minister , and he has a ph.d. in his hand .
and mike eat and more and less and less and only more . '' and yet it 's always and more powerful .
why ?
because it 's still left .
and i 've been looking at how much political it has , and i 've been able to put this back in the back of the pocket , and at the night , i was back
and there 's a thousand steps .
this was the way that was coming away from the cold coast to the house to the house to the office , where it comes to the office , it comes back with
and he came to a thousand game .
that means `` sputnik '' was at this day 10 minutes on the side of
and for 24 hours , a hundred minutes , a writer , or
in those conditions , diseases of themselves , in short
and in fact , it 's not so leonardo because it 's too much to lose -- because long is it up to the top of it , it would n't be used to it , it will
and first of all , the energy will be in terms of the way that you see
but energy is a disaster , which does n't go there .
the surgery rate came back in an van blood .
and yet she 's walking around , and she 's doing a lot of time and she
so the cyclist .
so if the energy is going to blood , the doctors will talk about the high and high voice .
and this link , the crash , as a result of , are the little black black in this campaign
and a happiness , there 's the whole little bit of the way , and the more famous thing about it and the little divergence and we 're talking
and now now , in fact , an economist right now has black pressure , because now he needs the blood through this tiny , interactive knee protein and
and if that tree goes to such a bat , it also does n't power .
and if that happens on the heart , we call the heart heart .
and if that 's in the fall , we call it the theater .
and in germany , every second in heart disease and a second ,
that means in germany , every second in a coma .
and it 's not so sick because it does n't get any water , it 's because he does n't move any more .
and if you do n't know those of those , then you can always be able to look at
for example , the subject of the matter
i still have even seen food at the moment , and there are a lot of coffee that i got a lot of
and if any book is just a child , and we would have this one , if we had a $ 3,000 meter of high history at this point .
and i read a job for them .
and there 's actually important if you take more energy than you do more food than you do it again .
and if you take less energy than you 're trying to do it , you will
that 's gorgeous .
but why do we need to get rid of books
it just makes you end .
the need is , of course , of course , but it 's not
because why is the cure to a 100 percent ?
because it 's a diet and not a common life .
so what happens the relationship that we 're doing here for three weeks and here , we 're going to go back with this struggle for the fight , back to the normal stage , to our normal life
what if you actually then go to five or seven weeks ?
nothing .
and so even the street and again a quarter of the body that we did n't have the case , what we did .
so , you 'll be going to spend a new diet today , where every new sample can ask , and you want to put this into your living , in your
yes , no ?
and if you do n't cry , then
and if you 're going to stay it just , you
because when the story is nothing , it 's just enough .
it 's the kind of tools that we want to decide whether we 're getting sick or
it 's the bad biases that make us low .
and these are the good learning that make us healthy .
and if you look at the mirror , it looks like this result , it looks like this .
if you look at the mirror , there 's a little bit of beer there .
and if you look at the mirror and be honest , it 's what it 's all about where it 's walking .
because if he 's poor diseases as good , he 's actually running in disease .
and if you 're going to take a look at the health of your goals , the dream of your dream does n't even go down to your
then he just takes good , as bad as bad .
and a really good example of an adult book is also a great example of the person who has a very interesting
in fact , it was now in the way , to put the movement out of a living point of his life by someone else , and every `` every ''
and at night , he 's sitting on the highway store , and he 's got to get some
so he turned into his own book in his own book room , and he 's going to the head at the back of the night , which is known to be an expert , and then you will be able to put that kind of a
and my boss would have had exactly the same as the way they
it was the place and the people who did n't understand it
this would have said , `` honey is not moving to people .
and somehow it 's right .
why do we have to spend in our pockets of night , always the same thing that we 've been
and basically , today , we need to have a little bit of a little bit of this
but it 's really much easier to find the movement where we lost it .
in the morning .
and so i 've been very pleased to give you a kind of art
maybe you can know that you can actually do this , you still see , you know , at night , you 'll see that in the night , and you
and that 's what you see how deep that was actually happening in us .
we always want to go and go to the more
we plan to have our own hip species , we 've been able to
we plan to be the whole life we ever need to have the interface to have this amazing , but we 're not there , we 're
it 's in a very different way .
and so you 'll be able to put the stage today and find the movement out there where they 're going .
i 'll love for the case of the time .
and i 'm the only one , i always left up and down , and i go up and down and all the
but if i had a moment to be here , i was now time to me .
then i 'm going to go back to the movement and then i 'm going to the movement
and if it comes to the production , it comes to 30 minutes , i 'm going to get
khalid steps .
that 's about three minutes away .
and a fellow , if you walk away from today , you 'll go to the end of the day , and then the fact that they would n't be able to the end of the
it may seem a pretty little bit of thing
but as a chemist , as a chemist , for a time , we let a lot of weeks ago at the year , we
we do n't have our bodies in our bodies .
and you give me my own interest for me , i 'm always going to miss it ,
the americans are crazy , the way that 's what they are doing .
this is a gallery from five pounds to hide .
i 've been at four pounds of this .
it 's just about if it 's happening with these little steps .
and if that 's true of this behavior , what i mean is what , if you really do , you really live into a medical life .
and these geese get the ones down from today and every day in their lifetime .
once you have a day , you 've got a little bit of a day , just a little
and if you wanted to lose and time and you have to do it in your own place ,
then they have a ph.d. , they even even more .
then they will grow it faster and faster .
but to do that , you 're not going to keep your health anymore
they do n't take their health anymore from their minds and from their time .
because the most important thing that you do now is now being more than a day
and i 'm a career for a career for a career
and for me , it 's more than a living time for me to make a sense that is in a very difficult order to life and to me .
because i believe health does n't have to do what we should do or do .
it 's actually health to do with what we want to do .
and so i just got to say , today , i just only just give
you just want to be just just just the best thing today .
and then you know , you know , like that .
step for step .
so thanks very much indeed
so , as an accident , a gentleman there is actually incredible , kind of , and a lot of the world of the world , and how
and so far to the extent , what can just do so far at its time , was n't it just enough ?
could we do that again ?
now , does it just like to do with a toy
and how can we make it and we can measure it for our future ?
now , let 's just start there on the question of what we really understand is on innovation
yeah .
technology has been used to research , and development even even the same as the government 's disease has ever
so they 're really really understanding me .
that 's great , all right .
and we can be very proud of it , and so we 're very proud of the fact that we 're in a lot of the world 's room that our lives will be around on the
that we have developed an extraordinary system of an evolutionary urban system .
but what about the future ?
now what are the challenges that we have to do is to a
and who is the point of the great , the great world and social challenges ?
so , dimitri seems seem to be a kind of thing .
a kind of security rule .
so the economy for the world 's social society is because of the world war , and huge applications that we can grow with peace and
and the world that is going to do the world better to take place in their own organizations and in the business and the leaders and the other who have to be so more expensive to be able to clean the
at least , at least they go
but who says that we have to look at this and that 's the way that
how would we make our budget to become more social and cultural growth ?
so if technological innovation also has cultural innovation , is that
so , what is the economic innovation also also have social
if we think about the goods of being able to think and to have the answer with the answer big ,
if there 's a whole bunch of economic forces that we 've been able to have , is a very different problem , but
because how did it be ?
both sides would want to , what companies , right ?
can this be done ?
ask yourself .
we 've been working on this as a symbol of being a
fortunately , there are more examples of the puzzle
larry mason has a lot of a sudden in online 's incredible times .
and interestingly , even more than in the basic opera to the point that the state of the state has been
and he has an expectation of a professional system , probably to get to the local minister
the chance i 'm going to do is i 'm going to miss a word to you with someone
you can go to the fact i 'm wearing a
it 's actually described young man .
it 's amazing , but it also also also as well as his
and so , that 's totally stupid .
i love the opposite .
and if you see the fact , you think , in fact , with the neighbors , we need to make our future ai n't worry .
yes , just after the trial , he then started to work somewhere in here with one of our ancient papers .
that 's what he 's doing .
that 's what he really like to him , and it 's also
and yet , there is something like that .
so he 's like , is there any more that this is in me ?
this is what the conversation of this starts on .
bats are actually in all grade .
and that 's what they 're doing .
and he also believed that as well .
so the right thing to be in the right place , which he 's going to see
so , not he does n't know anything about , but this is the way he says he was doing
and since in the middle of the morning three , three people did n't have that he did
and so , more of all , it was surprised to be surprised by him to see the indus
as an adult accident .
and as a result of the cultural education , he turned out to be
so that 's the great pleasure , so with young people , working together , his experience will .
and the two ones , they found out in their own
and always more of them have .
so how do we just spend this talk of the talk of the two times ?
so , you know , `` so , '' he was exactly , again
now what is the difference between the difference between the ancient age and an artist civil civil company
i do n't really know that way .
so , then , we 're going to start then start on the question of this question , what is to become
so , name says .
in fact , in industrial markets , private products , early customers , developed the world , there 's
and you can also give exactly exactly that the big way to get that kind of thing .
and once even , even once the very successful thing is , it can also be .
so what happens is that , actually , a diamond
so , sorry , you 're making your action job , it 's not that it 's not the small thing that 's not a big company
it 's something very different .
it has a completely different character .
because it does n't have any accident .
not an individual doctors , not a painter device , nothing is known .
from this , a b is an an random organization that is to be able to find a business model , to find the financial system , of course , of course , is to take its own muscle and then go
and you will understand that there 's a very like to have a very sophisticated organization , very different -- there 's other other , there 's a whole other
yes , that 's me really clear .
but what are we going to do ?
so , i 'm going to ask you to do that there 's been more successful and more successful money on the time
so , i 've been going to have a lot of a lot of a moment that was going to be very good , so at the
that means `` accident . ''
you have to have a chance to make your own and after your own bomb , your life
oh no .
real troublemaker ?
what do you think if you have a little 30 of your money out to your own money , what do you
so , you start to do the age of an ancient age , or
so what happens then with your troops as well , how do you know ?
and we 're also seeing the eradication of the coffee .
so the statistics of the people who do n't have a copy of a paper because a few percent of the world 's been a few years ago , in a much more sophisticated economic
money is always the result of a successful company , and a good leader .
sure , money is a power of transportation 's energy industry .
and it 's the basis of all economic health systems
but it 's never the goal of a company .
yeah , what about the goal ?
sebastian betti
so , if i get in love , i 've learned , well without the end of the word , the goal is not
and so , you know , maybe really have to be really and more powerful and more expensive
and if i did n't , all of this , i do n't think of it as if i do n't know anything about what i 'm going to do
so this makes no good feeling .
so , how do i say to choose and create risks that feel up to me all that way and feel it that way
yes , i 'm a believer in the art
but i could n't be there for you .
a monkey accident .
so this is already a moment , so it almost seems to be a
successful versions of generation has international .
a poet for a corporation .
so , how do you talk about today ?
now , the irony is , i 'm going
so we 're always saying `` well , '' and
in kibera 's design and accountability and the golden economy of the
so , we need to be
i 'm looking at the question of a dance for you .
okay .
yes , thank you , mr. susie .
but there are only questions to it .
you can just be able to be able to ask the key sustainable thing that the important is good
can we come up with this one , that i could better understand better ?
so the first answer is , i 'm here and what are i going to do here
yes , the question is , where will you go to the heart of the things that you see , the bigger is more than
what do you mean to hold in the world
what do people have to do when they work with them ?
what are you ready to give ?
what are your ice inside , maybe even , of course , sir
why is this important to see ?
because that 's also your current rate .
and how did we learn this ?
if you take a ship you did n't have the men to go to the same time to be able to fly your own pressure , just as a high , you just teach you
yes , good .
so i started to do a lot of questions for the next questions
what is my schedule ?
so what does this mean ?
yes , let 's now be the end of the thing that 's really
and what we do , of course , in detail , in detail , in detail , in detail , i 'm going to do a lot of you in a moment that
do you actually know the story with the pink ?
and then i 'm going to get a
do n't you ?
somi .
so , moving up .
`` you do n't have a professional movie , ''
okay ?
does it work ?
so , a brown elephant .
understood .
not a square elephant .
you see ?
that 's where we 're looking at if we focus on what we do n't want .
what is the only way ?
and then what happened ?
yes , sure , `` i 'm sure you 're supposed to do this .
so archie 's license or maybe the break at the crash .
but just a little bit about .
by the way , by the way , what do you want to do
i 've got a meeting for you .
harvest , if you 're the disaster .
and tesla 's convicted in the developed hemisphere of the bush
okay ?
at the same time , three degrees of an opera of what is called a `` a poet
i 'm an economist engineer of the moment of an architect right at the front of the time of the process of
i graduated in the bible gallery .
what i 'm going to do is , at the age of
and i 'm going to put some minister in the late 1980s .
feynman 's birthday named william smith .
oh first of all , `` first of the time
you know , what the other times of an instant is an unprecedented age of an instant age of
it 's got a way of
it 's a really , it 's going to be
the real square is actually distributed , is , `` the
and what is it like , and then ,
is you something that came from ?
has anything changed ?
okay .
okay , and the audience also .
okay .
so , then we 're looking at it , now we 're going to see where the hell is
and it 's true .
and tesla 's convicted in the developed hemisphere of the bush
okay ?
at the same time , three degrees of an opera of what is called a `` a poet
i 'm an economist engineer of the moment of an architect right at the front of the time of the process
i graduated in the bible gallery .
what i 'm going to do is , at the age of
and i 'm going to put some minister in the late 1980s .
feynman 's birthday named william smith .
and you know , how are you doing it ?
so i know one of the time i was also shocked .
i was really shocked .
when i first saw the first time .
i thought it was n't being true .
and more and more and more and a half feet was i was in my head , it was that i really have the whole time it was going on .
through my life .
and , okay , i understand that makes it makes sense .
and to put down the prison industry , we 're going to hear most of our knowledge of our senses and our success of
but what happens , then , is it really ?
what the hell i was , and what was the `` i was clapping
and therefore , in fact , your perception of being a very short thing , is more important than the best quality .
well , yeah , yeah , we 'll be the next question for the next question .
how could i really be my goal ?
so , i think that 's a good question .
the question i 'm going to see is , every time as well , and i do n't
yes , there are good news for you .
that will keep you easier to read when you might stop it to you .
because if you 're sure your own , your public movement , and if you put your online , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , i 'd
almost further .
you 're not going to be not going to be able to find a break in you and find things on you
these are the famous opera that you have in the front of the month .
and even yet , i 'm going to show you a lot of the way you can see to the people who are to pay for you to ask , there are more ways to get more of the
and you also have a big deal .
the density company have a great dome .
stephen brown wurman when the person did not go on it , it was in his 20s , in his own backyard
at the very famous table , the famous great table
and that completely different people .
so scientists , more and more , more and a politician , a student , like , `` the way that he has ,
but not in our most today games where the hell is , where do you go by that ?
who has right ?
but in fact , suddenly , of these different things , they came out of these different things that are n't like any of the other kind of life that
well , yeah , the next question is , what the other of the other next next
it 's just that way that it 's successful and the successful government that
instead of a big time and more high , and so on the next time it 's always going to be just
because what if you do , in the area of the memory , you
but the way to do this is very , very late with each of
and if it was n't , it was a moment to take away from the other other step .
and even if the big , apart famous was n't something , it 's almost more other .
and so it 's really important to tell her what is really important .
that gives you the inner security .
and in the way , we 're actually trying to figure together ,
although we did n't know , well , did anyone ever have said it ?
you know , you 're going to tell you too much
so , this funny learning , this one , and this dilemma of this , is now -- it 's also that the fun power is in a non-zero-sum situation in
and that 's also the same thing that the power system of uncertainty which is more than to do it as well
yes , thanks your hair .
so this sounds really great , really awesome .
but i do n't know what to do with my company , i 'm going to have to change a lot of food out there , that something happens
and for example , in germany , there is always this kind of fact you 've
and i 'm part of the politicians , because i need to make the politicians first , that it changes
okay . my boy , come with it .
like , here 's the water down .
what do you think you can be able to change a lot
10 ?
morton bast
ten million million .
look at this one .
who are you ?
right . that 's the same
that 's the one you can change , you can really change it .
or to say it 's by 19 papers to say the change that you can make in the world itself .
do you think nice words and big big work , but how does it work ?
we have now become more to the number of thousands of our success sites that
you can use that in every ancient minutes of happiness or if you 're going to make a little bit of something or if you 're a more active and they 're
and if you ask yourself what you 're going to be happy with now even be able to tell you what you 're going to move to , you can get
sorry , so sorry , for you , in your business business , i think you 're just going to be
and the end of the end , `` well , you know , what you really do is of this crisis , or what is missing is
so i mean , if you 've ever happened to them , at least , at least , they have
yeah .
`` yo '' thank you very much
and do you really think that i could do it all the way to my prescription
yeah , yeah .
and you can see , in fact , two things
first of all , one in the other side of the game of your inner script , that it 's
because that 's what makes your sense of
and the second thing that you can do is to take your own devices
because they do n't have to write how to communicate the other people .
the future is always going to change us if we change our own senses
do you have that to be you ?
yes , i guess it 's already done .
thanks your bow on the front of the
all right mentioned .
yeah .
what do you think about our mouths ?
nice .
really , or , ma ?
and how did we think we 're doing now with this dish ?
is that a new wave ?
i mean , yeah .
it 's clear .
i 'm going to see everything in the front side
and it 's called a fuel fuel
and that 's what the indus script really really mean .
a asteroid from the rise of the rings of
and no , i mean , new coffee , sir .
that 's the marketing proposition .
the moment that i 've been doing is the big famous name for a
by robert 's favorite year-old minister , i 'm going to be able to say you know ,
let 's just just be able to have a look at
and who knows may be seen in our head of our birth of our next year .
you can see it right , i 'm a journalist
so maybe it would be some kind of stupid that i have to give with kids and the future because after that , children are
instead , that 's the way i 've been working on most of the
i 'll start through a lot of my life in prison
four years ago , my father and i did the program , i started in the program , we started
we 're flying , we 're going to put up frank 's `` the name of the money to get either to raise your cell , or find out of your journey the
so why do so i have to focus around a way to make a way of looking at the moment , so the people
our program is a lot that easy to understand what the state programs are doing .
and frankly , i would have thought that the crash part of the last place in the universe is where i was working on .
what do you think is the most important person in the child that we 're working with , with the people who
we found out that there are some basic things often make the same kind of
and if you think about it , why it 's so many times and many of the things that the dad has n't even know what he does is he 's likely to lose drugs that he 's going to be able to do with drugs that he
and if you think of an young boy on the way he wants to make it from his life , maybe maybe nothing for the better idea , he may not have a better idea how other life
and he was singing his father .
i 'll be able to introduce a homework story
martin is the love of the program .
his father was a lawyer and was interested in the back of the family .
when he was 12 , his mother died and he and his little brother had to leave a little bit
there was the winner of the big bang .
he was convicted and he was an actor and he 's a perfect
until that day , a small friend with a computer , it was like , so far at , at a computer , it was
there were 4,000 in marketing when the carbon was going through , he was going down to the enemy .
and then it was on this day , he was
and so it went .
violence is the way in the way of his life , in the same of his
now how about the right now , that i 'm going to show you , are you
after childhood after , after a child , many jobs are more active or have
they do n't know much different than their illegal patterns and their daughter .
and then they 're able to put them a day with people to prison , and they are just going to go to the same thing that they have to take a
what do you think these people are in the way that they sit in prison ?
usually do n't work about no good .
and they will be able to do better research .
they sell drugs to spend a higher level of time to a higher level , and they would still be able to be able
and that 's what happens to germany in germany too .
that means in germany , every world 's second more active actually .
then there is people in prison who want to change really change .
but also those people will give you an apple device on the dead
and there 's a journalist there .
and everywhere you go , you can see your first identity .
whether you 're looking at yourself whether you 're looking at a school and whether you want to be a member of new relations , you 're going to be able to move out of this , this dish with this , this talk that you
this is the problem that we 're going to be .
how do we try to solve this problem ?
what makes you think , you believe , do many of the people
they 're going to be surprised .
it 's 3.2 skills .
who has an operation in a way of view of a sudden , from a party and a lot
in the process of real matter , it 's a little bit of a mess , otherwise it does n't end
and these devices want to use something positive and a kind
we 're starting to start our program with a success education in prison and three math .
we 're sending the emergence of stability and the economy .
every child uses his own business , and every one of them is part of a great
and then we found the people in the case of the season season , where the indus script at the heart of their personal relations and also with a different kind of
what about earth expectancy would like to come out of our program
it 's a big range , and the way to the main level of resistance
we have a diamond plan for an accident .
a very large amount of sand and a way is to introduce you to stand up
larry leaders and his theory of the most of the most money made him to have been very early with the federal
he had fun and had fun .
he 's been paid to the first time in front of the
and this one has n't touched it , particularly .
in the opposite .
he says today , he says , he 's got to win at this time
and what 's happened is that this is the second time he
he just then been part of the more creative part he would be in a
and then he learned how to use the power model of something .
he 's in the late soviet journal ; he started in washington 's case for the crash department .
the action rate is good , it can be alive .
he 's got a very good thing .
he 's here with me .
who 'd like to talk to the people who want to talk
again , even back to b , which i 'd told him to the beginning .
martin has been to take a war to the car , and he ended up in his career in the late 1980s
and there 's no way and drugs that are being really going to be really close to the main
he was working with being more than as a lawyer and
and for the past 20 years he was doing
and he says today that he was n't going to be the local nuclear weapon of nuclear nuclear .
one day he 'll actually feel a mistake to anyone in a way that he was in fact
he was sitting in the most part of the crash , and the crash was changed with
he learned how to power it too more success and to get more places without their open , without drugs .
and he was so excited by this idea that he decided to bring it to the other .
and he wanted to be part of the sentence .
that 's what it does .
he now works for two years now , and our children in the way of freedom , because he knows that if you want to change it , and if you have the right tools with hand , you have to make a lot more possible than you 'd
the basis of those success disease are like people like you .
people who are going to prison with us at the store of the blood force with us to do our job in their backyard , with their personal suffering .
these are our job , the earliest talks in our education , that are the students who do the job , the other who will get the
and these are our main , which we 're going to get to our participants right now
and also these people are very much from our program .
one example .
we 're doing a practice that 's called an ad named .
we then put into the center of the room to be a big state of our two leaders that we 're in and our home that we have
and i think of different questions .
and every time anyone in the room have a question , he says he 's a guy who looks at the
and here 's what we all together in , whether we 're sitting in a hospital or outside .
but also , where the difference is .
and an example of this where the difference is , is the one question .
i grew up in a hot social plane , or i had a dance student .
there are always many of our subjects at the line of the line and very few of our home sites
one question i 'd like to see the way that all of us are going to make the story i want to share
and i 'll tell you all she 's going to go up
maybe we can get a little light up in the audience .
i can see you .
there are all of them .
amazing .
thanks a lot .
i 'm now saying to you a question , and if you do the question , you do n't have it back again , and you 're just going
that 's kind of our line of our line that we 're going to
i have been doing wonderful things in my life , and i would have to get a little bit of a life that
if you do this question , you do n't have to put it .
and in order , in order of being able to make
maybe also , perhaps can have a little bit of a mess in the
in order , it does n't really have to have that math .
okay .
and it also matters , maybe any circumstances can not always be really smooth .
all right .
most eyes .
we have a few blood in the room .
that 's wonderful , that 's where i 'm happy .
thanks a lot , you can all be left back .
now with that question , if we take the computer on the computer to go to , we often get a lot
and a lot of them are clear , how much they might have been .
happiness with the parents , with the environment , with the environment in which they grew up with the friends but they may not be always excited by being a little bit of the day of the day or the world 's seat or the
what are the results of our jobs ?
so , we 've been looking at a local percent of our students that are out of
that 's fast fast .
seventy percent have already made up .
a third of the food atoms in the last year were an
and our success rate is at seven percent .
i 've been told the youngest director of seven percent in germany 's a crash in germany .
i 'm an undercover journalist .
a surgeon cost in an ninth meter of the 70 french billion .
and it 's a beautiful pleasure , a guy who normally did a asteroid who 's seven percent of who usually lost a community for a practice .
when my father and i started to put out of the job , we were open up in very short for very crazy .
i started a great company at my time to give my fantastic job in
but i have to tell you , i have n't been in my life in my life , not so much
we are teaching our customers to take responsibility .
milo , which is happening in your life and is interested in love for being responsibility to take what 's going to happen in their
it does n't hide . nothing too .
because that leads to a whole new sample and allows it to a human diet .
and so i 'm going to do that very quickly and it 's very happy to tell our clients 's open
i 've given you a little video .
film .
so i became a member of the two years of the world and eight months of
i was actually more interested in the way for the crash to three years and 10 months
i 've started with a ritual .
so i have been able to get some characters from two years , because dangerous
i became an undercover journalist in a sculpture of the world and a
so , by my life at ideo , it actually changed my life .
and what i really was important for me was that i was an artist who was done too
because there was my right , my mind .
i was n't an economist , i 'm not saying , i 'm not saying
i 've been making smart eyes on this time .
i discovered again , again , again , again .
and you go out of a different consciousness and the way it 's coming out of the
and it was always more and more and more and more and more and more and more and a half of the
with the sounds people , they 're not more more than that .
well , the problem is that a lot of choice have no , if the shape structure .
the biggest problem , because then the biggest problem , then it 's unlikely that the old will come back into the
you do n't know anything else .
through this funny piece of food , whether everything got put it on my own thinking , just my whole thinking of it , in my own thinking of view of the problems of society , the way that i just had been completely
i 've been a writer in my first woman for a second
and since about six months , i 've come to them with her .
so that means we have a new relationship .
and because i have to have a look at the whole age , and many other things have changed .
a lot of the things i 've been doing
i 'm with my family back to the training department .
so i 'm working in my research room now , and i 'm just in
i 'm going to go through a toy party for a
you have to really really understood that there are a very , very many people in this actually , like , like , my favorite point still and actually be there and actually be about the right , i do n't know , i 'm not sure ,
i 'm grateful for that , in fact , that they are actually the idea that they are , in the way
i 'm grateful for that it was very well in the case that they have to put more and more and more and i 'm very grateful that i
and of course , we also have the ones that were the ones that were there .
i was talking to a lot of people talking to me , and i 've always been in the process that 's good , that 's what 's going
and that 's what i 'm doing about now .
and that 's what i 'm saying about .
come up to the prison .
each of them has a little thing to do something .
whether you asked your demand to your degree , whether you 're going to be the disaster player 's seat , if you 're in the bottom of a
whether you want to get our program into a new plane , an ancient approach .
let 's talk about what you are talking
richard is the one i 'm today .
and let 's just give you a conversation with them .
thanks a lot .
i 've had a chance to say in l.a. 's case for the ministry of law magazine
in a time i was a little bit of a time .
there you are , in fact , things like
it 's for a regular game .
the court .
a hospital mall in the heart way .
there is a really lot of opportunities to be able to do with a living problem
you can see how to deal with this reef
anyway , i was also amazed .
i have my work and so as a way to the coffee .
i 'm actually going to talk about a toy here .
and not from the real problems .
my problem was an honor , and i could be pretty interested in love like my life in 10 hours , in a hundred years .
it was dreadful .
and that 's the kind of thing i found
to make it very much like the
basically , i had an expert engineer .
it 's like a thousand times
i just did n't want to get the way i want to go
do i just have to go with that
or what if i get a lot of time on a new basis
and look what happens .
so what happens to me .
these were the idea .
i was in this era for free grade in this time .
as a storyteller .
the surgeon was also the absolute public movement for me .
you spend the world living in very good home and you get the country on a very unusual way .
but then also also very , very productive countries .
now nations , where it 's safe to see more , and say , when there are thousands of thousands of thousands of people who have a little bit of a sudden ,
and that 's when i think about these images and the larvae of the same
and that 's exactly what was the case for me to do this .
i was really able to do that .
to greenland .
and also i found a little bit of a country about me to write a country , i do n't really know what i did .
that 's what i wanted to change
i wanted to have a look of a
to make the articles article ,
and to finish my personal interest .
how do you know about countries better ?
by the way you live with people .
in the human lives , in home .
not in the hotel .
by contrast , by the way , with the challenges of people ,
and by humans , you care .
at least , that 's the answer that i could give , i could give this question
and that 's what i wanted to do
and i also wanted to do something more unusual
i wanted to do a complete movement .
something good do .
and this feeling in front of me with a lie to even increase on a lie .
i was actually just touched in the developing world , in a way that was just very helpful
until there is a german war at all , a german war that does n't just have just been just just only but
with a $ 50 million of an average dollars of an average dollar , the poorest country
and certainly , one of the most 20 poorest countries in the world are
a quarter of population lives in the population of poverty .
almost a fifth of the population needs to disappear .
sebastian can not read the adults and writing it .
all these facts are connected with a lot of personal stories , and in the way i met this journey , i met on a time in the time i was ready to be ready and
i want to change myself anything in the way .
and she went out of my school for a lot of time .
i was singing my job .
and i 'm just talking to the aid .
and i 'm now now to a very , very an analogy of the answer that i received on my job
because it just was a given .
it 's a serious honor for conventional international design companies .
and not to a success for a poet that will be twice in a professional life , that it wants to be a more efficient in
hello .
is it still ?
my job was really serious , and good .
at least , i thought it was
and this answer was an italian journalist .
i really was amazed .
and of course , it immediately wrote quite a fairly smart answer .
and fortunately , never got married .
instead , i have this really quite cute in order to make good graphics .
i used it to be used as a secret to do my own company .
somi .
heart work and shoots miller .
one company that basically does exactly what was going on then on .
that 's the way , a country in different ways .
the possibility , a country , a really deal .
by talking to the people in life , i can work .
and that does n't work somewhere , but in fact , in the same
you can put in the way that the way of the
so , you need the same one
that means a lot of things you can actually study from good things .
you can do that in a good way .
now , that sounds like now to be doing a
it 's not .
now , sadly , it 's a social demographic
we use an opportunity to create a tool for sustainable development
instead , we use an analogy using the tool for sustainable development
so tesla , rape and product .
because the people who respond to travel on their death 's scientific tv .
they pay for their journey as a different child .
but they 're just going differently .
they live in an airplane .
and the most amazing thing is that not a lot of carbon diseases or a lot of really have
social ambiguity .
and practice .
and our parents also have the same election that they 've had to have to have
we can use our work for a public nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear weapons .
because just the infrastructure needs to be able to either
and we can use this sustainable projects for the other
we can also have to have a free study and support
so we 're spending a hundred percent self .
they 're not being able to do with their
and that 's a moment for the long system for meaning .
we started working in singapore with our work .
we have our programs go to school on 1900 .
and now after four years of time , i 've been married and my husband and my husband and i also have a team of a team for a
let 's take the way back the way down
or what if we get bigger ?
if we 're still going to go further now ,
if we 're not just talking about the economic sector and the sustainable system that we 're doing now , in
and then the individual hadron collider for the way ?
or even more individual steps .
that would be basically a new one , at that point .
one company that makes companies that are going to companies .
in other words , the same kind of `` jeopardy '' ''
do we want it ?
was the next question .
morton bast
we want to be safe .
we love entrepreneurs , and their creative companies .
because we are so far in a
because we are actually talking about the same language
because we are the same student dream .
because we understand the challenges .
and so in that year , we have an old age .
somi .
and with the time we 're using creative companies in their development and these days that we support by a certain people
and we 're going to find the probability , the disease , the more or the way we have
so they invented the personal social and ancient health health disease .
and we cut it down to the emergency christmas season
they 're also again , in a time .
one energy at the next time of an difficult cost to a greater degree .

where you might have even more even cute .
where you 're going to go too little , if you 're going to think

i 'm going to show you

that 's a very wonderful women from afghanistan .
with mr. jazeera and with a sudden .
it was beautiful , taken the great lot of years ago
and for years ago .
because they did n't have a market for it .
because they do n't know how they can improve the quality .
because nobody told you , which is , what design might come from .
we wanted to help these women .
and this year , in this year , is also a crash .

we 've been living in our backyard with our coffee class
and we 're starting to face with a japanese note .
a poet cover of a thousand acres of our women .
it does n't just get to the end of a year for a year
it also also help us to make a lot more bigger .
this first line is kind of social and a half of social , and in
so who wants to help this , that can make this a thing with a piece of a life , but he can go straight into the project with us
it can go back to the women and to continue .
at the time , we do n't only want to be five women a work for them
and that 's not just in japan , but it 's also in black and in other languages that we work in elections .
but this is a project that is only a project to our current space systems .
we 're working in all central areas .
in the middle of an opera , in the middle of an opera
because the work in just a field are just too .
what happens to the children when the women work ?
right .
that 's why we started in bosnia in the year of the year in the year of the year
everything is going to be growing all around us
and the whole thing is going to make a more more sense than a single project .
we have a chance to put us to the power of the different
the most common opportunity to then go on to the same work .
and finally , i want to take you now directly a journey now .

or at least for one short time , i 'm going to take a short
and look at what happens .
thank you .
before i start , i would be interested in the way that the people who are here you 're in there , have been doing some of the birds
i 'm not going to be doing the light right now , but maybe someone wants to sleep .
here is the bottom line here , i 'm
two .
now , here , i 'm not really sure , but on the bottom of the right , it 's already two that there are beautiful , and we 're just too coffee
i also have a building in the case of the building , which is that the ball of the upper mountain
this is the building .
together with three other people , i 've been doing the high in the last summer six months long .
and so i 'm going to start through this tonight tonight .
and now now , maybe some of you might be saying .
what is the supposed to do this
now , there 's a lot of other
but i want to explain a little bit about
so , what do you want to do the court on
and you 'd be back to the park or like anything
just a small little group of questions that tells us about friends , friends , colleagues have learned me , when they learned that i was part of a business company that i love to be the head of a , a
all the other things that we were in the back of the season season .
and here in this way , this is a little bit of a sudden square , and had a
and to make the basics of these texts .
but i know who the answer is , it 's not my way of scale .
and it was n't the ultimate invasion of the u.s. people .
what we 're seeing here is a sign of the indus conference that we 're doing here
this is a public space that is about private times , and so for many people do n't have to be at the point of the day , not say , but not so much it can be used to use the public spaces
we were a group of birth in the words with an architect age and a lot of the russian bush , the ones and
and we wanted to tell a different kind of thing
we were a medical team , and i have to look at this for a moment , because it was a very old team
from the most powerful architecture , by einstein -- politics -- and old bush , blogs , design , design , music , computer , i 'm a teenager ,
of course , with different social economic cultural , personal , for personal
our current partner and the way we have to
and we 've been able to do this in different ways , but in different ways also
and creative is actually fundamental solutions that we 've done to realize in the bush , in the device that we
we actually have an idea of losing the insurance vessels .
and so it was really that we 're going to be the computer with stories and ideas
we 've been hearing hearing and images .
and out of that memories and images , they try to develop some other events for the favelas .
and that 's the idea that we 've been always going to go and
we 're also used to as a national percent , we 're used to be using computers and
this was a commercial and an inventor , and a journalist was moved and was born for an hour
and the experience that we did to do that , in fact , i 'm going to go tonight
every city has been living active places .
the one area gives a face .
in many cases , they have been able to be able to be able to see as well as well as well as
they 're the dead places that they 're not often in the same way that we 're not likely to be in the brain of
so , for example , we have an interface , a lady ,
but also , this also also actually found the public , the urban places , will have a lot of it
now , in contrast , these places that want to stay in place also also have the same kind of other
what has it to do with me , like here , i like some of the people that are asking some
i mean , a lot .
these places where our city is not only a face .
no .
they 're the social places that are living in the city where our social lives live .
this is what we 're doing to our neighbors to our neighbors if we put on the way to the store .
and can those extent that we can just have a very a situation , right , and we actually see that the environment also designed the same way of the water
and we 're just being used to continue to grow
it 's got some other equipment , sometimes
but what 's security is a sense of community .
the more i 'm going to have this kind of public space in this , and that 's the way it 's also the same
and if i do n't intend to myself , it 's what you do is called the stone flow of a city .
we then moved in two challenges .
we can also predict the human consciousness of responsibility and services for their areas or in the same time as well as a
how can the peace be produced in a developed space
how can a break be produced to ideas ?
so , the way that they 're doing is to the informal and the end of these ancient teams and they would n't even go to the most
imagine you 're sitting here at the same time , and you 're wearing the front of the front , and reading the text .
love and men , we called them an idea that they would give them three possible for the more group of the success , which is what they had before , literally
you can pay your idea of a machine machine .
and the problem with most of the being being the most end of the
would you go ?
would any of you have to go to the event ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , it sounds just great .
there 's an opportunity for what kind of entertainment .
you can give them the way that it looks like in the
and as i said , it sounds great .
i 'm still trying to give a happy myself .
and that , because i 'm thinking , you ca n't really be able to use it , or maybe , or maybe
one of the first things is that traditional play is often too
that means , mostly , you do n't have any opportunity to create your way to do or create the alternative , but there 's actually a design of design and you have to decide whether you 're a writer or a child or a
or , like a friend of the day , what color the forest forest gave us to the
second , classic is rarely becoming more of information and the open line .
think about the three stages .
we have what we want to show them , and they will be able to build it .
and feynman and the chief are often the most ones i 've ever find , but
i do n't want to have a sense of what i do n't want to have a writer or a writer , if i even
it 's also different .
although despite the rate of the collective artists of many moments have been diagnosed , we started to have a
and we 've been able to share some experiences that i want to share now .
i would like to get a way to other people , to other projects , but also it was true to the city and politics .
because what you are , the way that the people should actually want to actually have to actually have to actually have to
if you really have the interest of a more education company , like this is often so many and more powerful and more and then we need to have the same
not last morning i 'm even in love with you all the time you 're sitting on here .
and that 's why i 'm really really going to find a lot of
i 'm going to say it for important , that you all go , and i want to give you about the self 's advertising for the disaster .
and i 've been all of you to all be aware of the fact that the way that we can make a new kind of
so we have to look at what the human consciousness are , the human consciousness , the responsibility and the law for their conflict and suffering to the world
first , for the way at ted .
in an meantime , there are on the emerging islands , citizens at the rate and different
what we see here is a street store that we asked .
what we see here are some of the planes and the rains in the conversation with a
the goal has to be that all these moments of games on that , so that the indus job of the most least are n't the most successful ones , or the former
the citizens were experts , they 're experts for their spaces , they know what they 're missing to , which is what they are missing with a place to build a place in which tradition is a place and also what we 're doing
the surgeon that most of the city can come to the city of the city to be able to do at a level
in the meantime or in your particular case , then we can actually have any more warning for the work that just on the project that 's now on the project
this is all going to go to a coffee plan where all information for all the world and then can get the place .
and then you can also be able to get able to be able to be able to
and a conversation on board means that the message of the multiverse actually become a serious seriously .
and that 's when someone says i want to leave a word against the driver 's seat .
now , this may be , of course , in a sense , but the goal must be , in a nutshell , just talked to everyone about what is the right solution , and maybe you can see in the wake of the crash
as i said , it 's got to get out of the conversation .
second point are different languages .
our buddy is limited .
one feels totally likely to be , if he 's a little , abstract , a regular group ,
another thing can be to say , but the blood pressure does n't give you that not a big group
maybe another , maybe a little bit like that ,
or you can see it 's a ideas in an ancient
what i want to say is to give people different advice to be a different demographic .
we have the possibility to come up here to be there , just to be on what happens .
in the background , small show a little
we 've got the opportunity to give up in a campaign .
we had the opportunity to paint .
we had the opportunity to write .
so , from age of age
this was a young girl .
we had the opportunity to connect our ideas with our faces , with playing ideas .
also the ability to get outside of the marketing would have been to get out of the way .
this can happen with a plane that can be considered over the ancient times .
the sugar and the air rouge of the results are using the only under the conditions
we 've had to take all the entire process on facebook , and on one of those degrees of paper , and we 're now most news
our third thing is going to square
you may remember me to be often in the way that i was told to be a lot
in my 20s , we had three in three of the world 's
now , the process is , but if you have a department of life and the elements of the money itself , you ca n't know what to happen to the
when the computer piece and then i 'm back to the point of one of the world 's going to be , i 'm again , what i 'm
but it 's also been by the way for the
and then , if not just in the beginning of being able to come out that the indus script is like this and it 's like this , it 's all about
now what happens is when people get out of their city and their city ,
it 's already in many projects right now .
i have an example of a sample in a sample , which is the main minister , is probably known to a lot
in new york , just started a project where a coffee is a disaster .
in the meantime , there are an unprecedented artist in there six weeks of dollars that make the money for you to do , or
now the time has been written to the washington force , not different , as the idea of her own .
and also the success success in new york , where i do n't have to say more , because it has to be one of the most important aspects of the city 's not an idea of politics or in
the opposite , the head for the gold press already arrived .
in lebanon , in a nutshell we 're back back into germany , the citizens have already been given to the production evidence of the company
the city had been ever had to get a lawyer in the
the four weeks of the day that we 've introduced for the election , the rich was true to a square
today the city is the city of the city .
as the page goes to drop up to the top of the top , and the city that 's in the back of the world 's family and it 's
and together , people are actually building their own boxes on the
in haiti , a german bubble became a german
all right , so you want to say that .
we 're just going to continue now now this to go
but i think it 's wrong for god the city for responsibility .
why ?
one of the , because it 's a view for the whole thing , or should have .
as the rate of life , or it 's the citizens of the people who are now in the rule of the rule of them in some form of the brain , is that the city will only be the responsibility for projects
and then , with the other part , if the city starts to help each projects , other people have
a german company can only get out this just place .
and also the goal was created by a young company for her to first , about a half years ago , the results and the responsibility of the city wanted to be
and the way that we 've been doing is a computer video ,
we 're going to do it again
and so unfortunately , we have a problem in the moment that we do n't have to use the responsibility
but we know in the case of everyone now , if the city is the most successful successful , if the conversation actually have failed , it 's going to be a disaster place .
in fact , the shape of the species is actually open .
to finish , i believe that many projects that are important to be able to build complexity and create their own being a chance to create a fair disease and a game .
if you 're just going to be able to get a living and a half
in each one of the city and human companies
in each of the city and you all have to be there today , you 're sitting
if we treat our job and we started to the people who not no longer feel up as a symbol , but as a result
that 's it .
yesterday after the way that we were in oxford grade the day of the season , and i was in the
we talked about the past .
so this idea , even a second chance , if it did n't have any sense in this life , it just does n't have a second chance .
we were very excited to that .
and we were very quickly telling us that there are two things that we do n't want to experience this .
this is the computer one .
the second thing was , immediately , at the table , was there still in school still
anyway .
anyway .
school , some of you may remember , maybe even in front of you .
so with me it 's my job now , it 's like now , the age of the age of the age of the game , but
my grandfather won , and i just want to get back to dinner .
and then i know it was not , as you were to them in my 20s , it was the one that i always found the most amazing seriously , and it was always going up
no one idea what one was actually .
you 'll understand it , i really did n't really beautiful , and then i went to my last talk about my last birthday , never even in school .
and what i 'm going to say , if i 'm doing this year , i 'm going to have some of the most beautiful days i 've been working on , i 've spent
with big fun and totally dancing .
how did it get to ?
how could this happen ?
and so it was time , so that 's what happened to me , what i 'm not doing is actually
i was going to die .
so , my wife gave the children .
and so then , as it turns out , it was clear that they had this surgery to make this resistance .
until that one day , she said , `` it 's a disaster failure .
and now you 're going to go up
yes , uh .
and i would come up and then i was in this plane , and i was in this case , and i felt into the back in
and that looked like this , as it was in us .
and the conversation also as i went back to school in school , and i was a student student who said that person who had actually changed out a
and when i left the teacher to tell you , and you know , the kids do n't learn for the school , but for life like this , i 'm sorry , oh my god , the sentence , i did n't have a privilege in there .
what is the thing we 're looking at school from this university of the night is really made really ?
so many of us have a very good thing in the right place
where have you actually , in your life , have you really good well ?
and maybe some people know , like the evolution of being honest .
what is the more common industry ?
or `` you can see , this ability to a moment within a moment , just to make a lot of knowledge in a coffee way , just how i can then go to
well , i 've been able to do this , but get it on the board ,
and what does a mean of an asteroid a moment of how someone else does a great doctor ?
and if the muscle is in and if the good of these properties have
anyway .
so , no way for life , not for school is not for you .
if we looked back like a age of about 25 years ago , the 21st century was now , and it 's like ,
this is the time in germany that ran in a completely completely completely being built .
and wherever the education , as we 've now has its power power .
and if we remember the time back , it was actually the people who had no access to the knowledge of the time .
and there were those four or six years they were just forced to go to school at school , and with knowledge were made that were really the only way that had the ones and the facts and the facts and the facts and the facts that they have in contact with the
today , a fbi is more information in its pocket than the largest library of the time .
and the third of the 19th century , which was the time of the u.n
that means there 's a certain changes in the world , and there were a lot of people that could bring these new machines to these new
but in the same time , people were able to sell these machines and they could make
and we needed people to build these machines and they were able to put those trees .
maybe it 's what you 've seen .
the crash system that we have to do with germany in germany , has to have its call to the end of the time
and there 's probably going to be able to
and it probably was n't really that , in the school that i have learned in school for the work of work in the morning , who was on the most edge of the tv , who was the head of his life
let 's make the way we can do the same
let 's see the 21st century , where it is , and let 's see it in the year .
the year was the year that the first ever ever been to jump on to the first time to
i was working with my work with my work , and i thought , now now , you 're going to be your own cell ,
yes , after a few to me , i would take up with the internet , and then i 'm a journalist , i 'm going to be
and some companies are in us and we 've been getting bigger and increasingly bigger , and we 're so nice in getting it down , and some of the companies we 're going to have to be back back into
you can always see two times in life .
and we had 30 to 30 people a few years .
so , we had a wonderful growth , and we had been used to spend jobs in the afternoon like an example , an old
i do n't know if you 're going to have physical idea , what these people do , but when i went to school in school , we were n't really thought that would ever be there
even when i was an actor journalist , what we do n't talk about was the internet ,
and the kids that we are now will take us the job at 10 , 15 , 10 , 20 , 20 years ?
the only theory of the mind we did n't have any idea
and what do you know what are the facts that you need to get to become successful in that future ?
and if you 're honest , there 's the only answer , we have no idea .
and because we 're doing so much in the future of who could , i think , because the crash is going
there 's an ancient bush , and i read it .
well , you see , they have no idea .
how do we get to figure out what we 're learning for school ?
what are the things we need to make the children to make it live ?
and maybe just to do that in which one companies are about to have a school today .
that 's the time of school , right ?
the students of schools and the north and north us , they come into
and if you look at an example of an evolutionary kind of an classic game , it 's going to be in the first place , as the
so here you want to , so it 's like to read , you know , we 're looking at an artist age of 10 years old , and we
that will be at school and even to be able to afford to the
but maybe what you might have , but maybe maybe can be able to do the things that are going to be important , that 's the so-called `` jeopardy '' and i 'm actually sure that this lady will be the most difficult thing
and you can actually put in the position of three groups .
this is one , companies wants to decide the employees , the ones are , which is a breath for the dung
then , almost all of you think of it almost .
and then you want to sell these companies to get the job .
so we have smart leaders , and we have a little
let 's start with the circuit of the fuel
that 's pretty fast , is quite the
if we look at how education works today , how fast , how fast it changes .
in accident , in the internet of the internet , will be to the internet today .
there is one more more , i would sell it to the change of the
there is more time i would sell , the creative ones .
there is more time i would sell , the wings .
this is pretty exactly the opposite of what happened in the factory end of the 19th century of japan at the most time .
the second thing is that life is actually pretty clear .
there it goes to the responsibility .
there it goes to people who are responsibility .
first of all , for and their own lives .
but also the big deal .
whether this is now the company or the society we want to help us we want to take responsibility of the big space .
and the third one factor , which is the blood , which is almost going to be
and if we remember the five people in the late place , there were this beautiful question on the internet .
in fact , in 1990 , adam has won a crash and germany has a
it was n't an illegal speaker who 's won the middle .
this could be able to do in common .
and as somebody who , i have a big student , steve jobs , yes , an egg .
it was n't the one who was invented to the iphone who did n't invented the crash , that did n't have an child child . he did n't have a lot
and it had a team that made it possible , because only as a team could have to do something that they have .
so in school , these three things could be able to take this , but it 's actually going to school that we learn to be alive
but there 's still more ancient case , and this is still important .
and that 's what it is .
if the only thing we can say about the future security is , it 's not sustainable , it 's the ability to learn , it 's the ability to learn , always , to learn , to learn a new way to learn , and to try and to the extent that we 're going to live in the future
this is what happens to be at least school , these things ,
but where was i ?
i was sitting in this plane , and i was sitting in the front , and the kids who have know that this is not just exactly what they have to pay for .
that 's how the event after the front of the front of the moment it was all
and to the point where the word are the operation , then all of a sudden suddenly all invisible
yes , i was sitting there , and i would say , at the time of one of my kids , i was still going to have the homework
less of all , it was as a parent for me to be a parent when if it was driving the subject of the hard child and the
and even less fun is that the child will become sick , because in school alone .
and finally , this was a member of the end or was an entirely photograph of this school , that was so
in fact , it was n't a lawyer , it was kind of a coffee experiment , so it 's the last hour and we were in real , and we were the only parents who were
and i 'm going to talk to you now , and i 'm going to tell you the details of what happened to me , that we have to get our child
but fortunately , for two years , where we 're wired , it does n't work .
what do we do in the wrong ?
and we actually had to ask us the question of your child 's question ?
and are we just in the only one who 's going to go
now , i went to the last two years since i talked to have a lot of people 's work , and i realized , i would have to figure out , you do n't get it alone .
there are many , many people who go similar , and this was , two years ago , so i was working with a journalist , we were just going to have a new company , and we 're going to have to think about where the journey of the journey were going on , at night , we were going on the screen
and what i 'm going to say , he almost almost the same story , he 's almost the same thing that he 's doing , and we had to get our kids out there , did we have to go from school , yeah ?
in canada , there 's an unprecedented disaster in a row of different schools , and we could even move it
but can it be there ?
somehow we had to do something to get our kids to be more and more to get to get this out out there .
and after we both have the same , we had n't been able to have changed this stuff , in school since we have been to change it , we 're all the first ones that the right now .
only , how are we going to change anything ?
the good thing is that we 're arguing for us .
we 're not alone .
but we 've been able to find very quickly in this series of amazing people who were trying to have to be , in fact , we 've been able to do school
it is n't that only the children and their parents are in the words that happens out there .
if we look at the teachers , we 're about 30 percent of the teachers have
if we look at what the number of the world 's crash are changed in the last 10 years has changed .
can it be so anybody who 's wrong with false ?
that all the children are being raped and that the teachers were being ready ?
or can it be that we have a school system that just as it would n't , as this did n't as if this was a typical ago ago , when i was a little bit like
and we have found a lot of people that were going on , and we even found people that did n't have children who have
and they understood that they need to take responsibility to the future that they need to take responsibility for the future , by using responsibility for what we 're going to do , and the kids that are now going to school to take to take a path .
and we 've been hearing ourselves now , in fact , there 's a lot of great factors out there , there 's going to change school , and there 's a lot of schools , and there 's really great , and there are almost on every school teacher who are really
and there 's even one or other other versions of the brain to go to the very first campaign .
and how should we help us now ?
we did n't have a clue to get there right now .
but we can do one thing , we can go to the schools and we can go to the schools and we can go to the people who school , so the parents , the teachers and the students , we can move them with one that in two days .
so there , people , put together in the past so much like they 've been working on their work and have learning the learning of two days in which it
they come up with the very basic challenge they solve .
and after two as long as you 've been building a new , new device or the mouse for a new , we 'll have some new life as we can do at a school
or they have a tremendous interest for the most kind of problems that they have in their school , developed
within two days together , developed entertainment that can be used to get to a day or a day
but what is most exciting thing about what , in these two days , and this is what i 'm doing so beautiful , the few of the things that i have , and also in the schools of schools , is this energy that will learn when the three things

and that 's incredibly scary .
and i forgot to think about the new world as a school .
i forgot to think about school as i said .
and i forgot to her , as she was in , she 's talking to speak about school .
talk about what you might be talking about , but also what you 're not talking about .
they will be surprised how much they get to them and how many people have happened the same , but just not using it .
let 's take them every single school in germany to get a century in germany .
let 's change the entire system .
and let 's take it together with the people of the school day to the parents , with the parents , the teachers and the students .
because they can actually get together in the way .
thank you .
